0,"We were at the Hyatt for a conference at the Hyatt. Other than that it was near the elevators, the room was perfect. The hotel provided a lot of assistants for helping conference attendees find rooms and other venues. While always a bustling den of activity, everything was fast. I couldn't believe how quickly they fed so many people at the buffet lunch or how many they could get up and down stairs so quickly. They have created many great nooks for hanging out or working downstairs. The workout area has many treadmills, but nothing else other than a fabulous view. On the negative side: I do not love exorbitantly priced food (water for over $8) being placed in front of me in the room, tempting me to spend unreasonable amounts on items I could grab with a two minute walk downstairs.",12-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
1,"Chicago & Hyatt helped us get a fresh start on the school year. This location is within walking distance to parks, eateries, entertainment if you feel the need to leave. It has many sitting recharging stations. A true home away from home!!",12-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
2,Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago and it was a wonderful stay. The room was on the 30th level and was super quite and great for a business trip. Hotel is close to many attractions and fantastic restaurants within walking distance.,12-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

4,"Great location right on the river walk and a block from Michigan Ave. Clean comfortable room. Getting a room with the city view is definitely worth it.

5,Spent four nights there with my family. Could not ask for a better location. It was tough to swallow paying $70 a day to park but overall was a good value for the nice room and location. Staff was also extremely nice.,11-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
6,Hotel is beautiful and very lively. The Mexican restaurant was closed most of the time and the game area for the kids never had the games out when we were there. Other than that it was awesome.WE love that theres a 24hr store/ cafe that has quality food & a starbucks drink menu! We always stay at Hyatts! They are the best !,11-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
7,Loved the location and the view and was very pleased with the property and all the amenities. Reserved a king room and upgraded to a Jr suite view room and we were not disappointed. We checked-in to room 2427 in the West Tower facing the River.The room was basically the size of two normal rooms. It had a bedroom area and a living room of equal size.I liked the large seating areas where we were able to gather our luggage after we checked out and prepare for departure. Great restaurants and really enjoyed the Big Bar. Didn't care for the mini-bar/snack bar with the pressure sensitive pads where the slightest bump triggers an automated purchase.The sliding door to the bathroom was a bit heavy for my wife pull open especially with the tiny handle on the inside.I did appreciated the double-door entry and matching sconce lighting. ,10-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
8,We stayed for a weekend and the hotel was great. Had all we needed and more. We travelled with our two daughters and it was great. Excellent location and amenities.

9,"This was my third time staying at this Hyatt and I was again very impressed with the service and quality of the hotel and all of its amenities. The friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever seen, and they go out of their way to make sure everything is just perfect. This was my first time eating at the restaurants in the hotel and I must say I was very surprised to find that the food in all of the restaurants was AMAZING !! I never would have expected such high quality products, genuine home cooking taste, and great portions for very reasonable prices. I especially enjoyed the Walleye Tacos and the chicken wings. Both utterly delicious. The taco bar in the ""Living Room Lounge"" of the West tower is also a must !! You will not be disappointed eating in at this hotel.",10-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

11,"Booked the Millennium Suite for three days. Room wasn't ready until 5:00 pm. The room itself was in poor condition, half of the sofa was missing so the ""living area"" was not usable. Furniture was chipped and overall beat-up. Pain pealing from the door, stains on the curtains.VERY disappointed, as Hyatt typically has higher standardsNote: Location is amazing, but there are other hotels nearby",9-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
12,This Hotel has plenty of seating/sofas all around the Hotel! it provides a very relaxing atmosphere all through the day. The location is absolutely fantastic right by the River walk!

13,Not worth the money. The location and view are great but the staff is snotty and not cooperative and the rooms were dirty and dated. The pillows were like giant sand bags from gym class. I will never stay there again and i was looking forward to a fancy stay. Definitely not the case,8-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
14,The second we checked in was the start to the best customer service I have ever had. Even the bartenders at the Big Bar were Fantastic. The room was super clean and accommodating. The location was also amazing. we were able to walk to a lot of places we wanted and its so close to the bean! the views on the river were not bad to look at as well. I would 100% stay here again!,8-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

19,"I was disappointed with the Hyatt Recency Chicago. I have stayed at other Hyatt hotels and I am part of the World of Hyatt, but this hotel needs some updating. We had 3 different rooms on different floors and was disappointed with all 3 rooms. The carpet was dirty and dingy in all rooms. The bathroom clogged in one room and they had to replace the shower. Another room had 2 double beds when they paid for 2 queens. Although we were up high our views were of an apartment complex. The location is not bad, but I think I would stay on the other side of the river next time.

20,We travel alot and have experienced alot of stays in hotels.

21,"The Hyatt Regency Chicago has a great location and was super helpful with all of our questions. As a first time visitor I called a few days ahead of time and got very helpful information on how to get to the hotel, and get around. The location was perfect for us. We spent the morning/early afternoon walking and exploring and were able to make it back for a quick recharge before heading back out for the evening. Next time we come to Chicago, the Hyatt Regency will definately be our choice!",7-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

29,"First: I have to say that I am biased...I LOVE CHICAGO! It is such a wonderful city and I'd probably be happy sleeping in a tent in Grant Park just to be there. I have been 5 times and every time, stayed at a good hotel so I am happy to include The Hyatt Regency on my list. Billed as ""The Largest Hotel in Chicago"" it really is BIG and quite busy but even so, it was a really comfortable stay.My Husband and I were there for the IRCE Show and it is obvious that this spot caters mainly to the business traveler. Our room was in the West Tower, 6th floor with a lovely view of the river. The bed was really comfortable, a blanket and extra pillow was provided (my Husband is a Pillow Hugger). It was very quite- which is rare in a large hotel- never heard Elephants over us or conversations through the walls.My only real complaint was the bathroom. No counter space, no storage-other than a small shelf under the sink- and terrible lighting. I'm still surprised when I see bad lighting in bathrooms these days. A Guy on his way out to a Trade Show probably wouldn't care but Women DO! I don't wear much makeup but I had to put it on at the desk next to the window. Space-wise it was decent and the towels were fine but the shower/tub combo was dated. Water pressure was ok but not great.They have a stocked fridge in these rooms- the kind where you will get charged massive amounts of money if you even think about moving that pack of M&Ms. There are a few other snacks on the counter as well. We did not need to spend on those as we took advantage of the Amazon Go store around the corner- which is awesome! First time seeing one and for a traveler, it's the perfect solution.As long as you have the Amazon app on your phone- you are good to go.One plus is that the Hyatt Regency provided vouchers for bottles of water- appreciated that a lot.Location wise- you are right along the river so you have beautiful views and are adjacent to the best that Chicago has to offer. Be prepared to walk EVERYWHERE.It's safe and a lot of fun. One day, I clocked over 21,000 steps on my Fitbit. Bring comfy shoes and take your time on Michigan Avenue. For a really great time, check out the Wendella Architecture Boat Tour. We went out on a mid-week evening and it was wonderful.There are nice bars and restaurants in the hotel. We had the breakfast buffet the day we left- it was good but not great. Didn't hit any of the bars as we have favorite restaurants in town but they looked lively. All-in-All, it's a really nice hotel and I would stay again....hope they rethink those bathrooms though!",2-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
30,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about my stay at the Hyatt. I would definitely stay here again. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. The view of the Chicago skyline was nothing short of spectacular. The food was well prepared and the staff was polite and eager to help. The breakfast buffet was delicious. The hotel is centrally located very close to all of the activities we enjoyed in the city. Most of which were well within walking distance of the hotel I was very impressed; and so was my date.

31,Had a wonderful stay. Everything was great except the in room phones did not work and the water in sinc faucet barely trickled out. The faucet was an easy aerator replacement and fix but the phone were not fixed at all.

32,"I have stayed here many times. What makes it special? Beauty, top notch service and ""extras."" Extras? Like a breakfast island surround by water in the lobby.

33,"The hotel is clean, our room was quiet. Lots of amenities but the best part is the location.

35,I liked the location of this hotel - right in the heart of the City. They charge $69 per night for guests to park which I think is WAY too high. Plus $75 per night for incidentals. If you stay for 5 days you will spend $720 for parking and incidentals. Parking and incidentals costs more than the room. Also my sheets didn't smell fresh. The bellmen and front desk staff were excellent.,1-Jul-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
36,"Rooms were okay, there was really nothing special the location was great but honestly that was the only thing appealing about this hotel. I had reserved three rooms for my friends and I and asked that they be somewhat close to each other. Ended up having two rooms on the fifth floor and one on the twelfth. Also had my reservation under a third party a couple people backed out and I called and asked a month ahead of time if I could change my three rooms to one suite and pay the difference if there was one and they would not let me. Was told breakfast was complimentary until there was a bill for $27 per person at the end. Also called ahead to see if someone else could check in as I would be there later and instead of authorizing that for all three rooms they took that as one room. Ultimately it was nice being closed to things but the hotel showed the value was only really in its location.

39,A good location in the heart of Chicago.

44,"Food was excellent. Service was optimal in all departments. Bartender's were welcoming to this single woman traveling alone. All time favorite attribute of the hotel (aside from location), how present and alert everyone was. Came to check-in, bell man gave clear directions where FD was. Stepped into hotel, forgot all instructions-distracted by the awe of the place. No worries, someone was at the the bottom of the escalators to remind me where to go. Did not know which meeting room I needed to go to, two ladies were quick to get the answer for me. When I went to use the touch screen board, more help was offered. Could not locate meeting room, more people came to assist. Walking in the wrong direction for restrooms, I was quickly guided to the nearest restrooms. I'm not trying to highlight how much of an idiot I am. I was just blown away on how quick people were to respond. I'm fine with trying to find things on my own, but I'll never turn down help and your hotel always had friendly people around to help.

49,"I don't know where to start. My experience has been so terrible that I write this review while I'm still staying here. Service: The moment I got here, I was heading to the check in counter and the woman flagged me down, said she could help check me in. They nickel and dime you here, want a higher floor, pay extra, want a better location room, pay extra. I said I just wanted a quiet room because I am a light sleeper and she put me in a room she says they put airline staff for that same reason. Great! What did I get? A 4th floor room (this hotel has over 30 floors) that faces....the Chicago Fire Department. Wow. Major fail on all levels. My work colleagues all got higher floors with no extra charge. Rooms: Tired and desperately needs an update. The bathroom smells of mildew and the shower had a clump of hair stuck to the back wall which was completely disgusting. Cleanliness is obviously not something they value at this hotel. Mattress is lumpy with one side slumped. You will hear your neighbors upstairs and on the sides. The walls are thin which is amazing for a hotel of this size.Location: Probably the only saving grace. It's walking distance to a lot of touristy sites if that's what you're here for. The only reason why I gave it two instead of one star. The other reason for the extra star was the fact they have a water refill station in the lobby so you don't have to destroy the environment by buying bottled water.I only stayed here due to convenience for a conference and since my work team was also all staying here. Normally, I would stay at one of the Kimptons in Chicago which are fabulous. This was a major oversight on my part - never again will I come back to the Hyatt.",26-Jun-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

52,"My partner had a conference here, hence why we stayed. I normally prefer small quirky places so this is definitely not that. However, the hotel is in a fantastic location - close to most things so I was able to walk everywhere.The room was very good - large, mostly quiet, clean and comfortable with a king size bed. The wi-fi was excellent. However, we missed out on a good view that others have talked about - we had buildings opposite us so had to keep the curtains closed most of the time. Disappointing for me as I am a keen photographer.The room has a safe, iron and ironing board and large TV. There is a laundry service. Things I weren't so happy with were the terrible tasting coffee for the in-room coffee machine (also only paper cups provided); no recycling bin (though I read afterwards that housekeeping separates these items - I do hope this is the case); minibar with no room for your own items - don't remove anything from the fridge or you will be charged (however, I have since been told you can ask for a fridge if you have personal items); I asked to borrow an umbrella from reception and was told by the grumpy lady that there would be a $50 charge if the tatty old umbrella wasn't returned. And finally, housekeeping changed our sheets and towels after our first night even though a note says they will only be changed after three nights. So after that, we put out the sign on the door to not disturb some days.Check-in and check-out were excellent. And there is a market downstairs and a slightly expensive cafe/restaurant/bar which has very good coffee.",25-Jun-19,Hyatt Regency Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87617-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

57,"Honestly, I haven't been so disappointed in a hotel stay in a very long time. I respectfully submit this review because Chicago Inn has got to do better. I'll be going into a few things that desperately need to be addressed. First and foremost, please make sure your rooms match the elegance of the main lobby. Maybe elegance is to strong a word but it sure as heck looks a lot better then the overall decor of the hallways and the rooms, well at least the two rooms I was in; more on that later. Ok, let me go back to the beginning. I originally booked my hotel stay for a week but unfortunately my flight was canceled and I was cut down to four days instead of the five. As you can imagine, I was already on edge upon arrival but thankfully the flight was fast. I quickly got over the loss of a day and I was quite eager to enjoy the Chitown. So, I go to check in and the process was long because I missed a day as I mentioned and for some long drawn out reason, they had to reestablish my reservation in the system. To the front desk reservationist credit, he admitted it was his second day on the job and thanked me for my patience. Full disclosure here, my reservation was made through a Groupon but that shouldn't matter. Anyway, I get things squared away at the desk and I'm given my room assignment. Now why did they put me in a room right next to a loud compressor. The compressor was making so much noise I could hear it when I got off the elevator. When I rounded the corner and saw that my room was right next to it, I didn't even go in. I went back to the front desk and asked for a room that could provide me with peace and quiet because I find it hard to sleep with loud noises. Well, I wouldn't be so lucky the second time. This time, I was given a room on the same floor (15) diagonal from the elevator. The rooms AC was warm at best and the TV didn't work the entire time I was in residence. But wait the nightmare continues. After trying to hype myself up to tolerate this mess, I decided the room was entirely to hot and I needed to be able to get a good night's rest, after all, I paid for decent accomodations and this was not it. So, I wrote down a list of issues and headed back down stairs and spoke to JC. I explained my situation from the very beginning and he was quite sympathetic and he tried his level best to make the situation right. Unfortunately, he sent me right back to the room that I was originally assigned. Now at this point, I'm just done but my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to go in the room this time. It was a hot mess, no, the room was not hot, it was entirely too cold and musty. At this point, I'm thinking, these must be the Groupon rooms. Why in the world would would they be looking into the computer for so long, I get it, they must have room specifically for Groupon. Long story short, I went back to the front desk and told JC. That I would just stick to the room I was originally assigned. I didn't even mention that the room he offered as a trade was the room I was originally sent to. He could tell I was disappointed. He knew I was disappointed because the list I went over with him outlined the myriad of problems like the wallpaper peeling off the wall, the leak behind the toilet or the fact that the tv was unable to get a signal the whole time I was there. I would have requested ba refund but Groupon prohibits that. To be in the heart of everything and just minutes away from Miracle Mile, Chicago Inn leaves a lot to be desired.

71,"After booking through TripAdvisors third party, cancelon, I received a confirmation for my room. After a great night out for my moms 60th Bday we went to go check in and the young lady at the front desk kept telling me she does not have a reservation for me. I asked to speak to a manager and with attitude she replied “I am the manager”. Her service and attitude was so horrible that she even realized it and apologized at the end when we didn’t receive a room and even said no worries I’ll review your hotel soon. While I was working through trying to get the room i reserved, my mom was being kicked out by security for opening the door to a man who stepped outside the side door to smoke. Since the security gaurd didn’t see him go out and only caught my mom being nice by letting the man back in, he yells at her and tries to kick her out. I was done w the hotel by now. Luckily my sister got her room because of a 7pm checkin so my mom me and my other sister all crashed in her room. Thoughtful enough the security man realized my mom was in the right and so was I after noticing that we couldn’t find another hotel to stay at at 2am.

78,"After reading reviews of the hotel, I was a little worried about staying at the Inn of Chicago. I kept my reservation to see for myself, and I was pleasantly surprised! I especially appreciated the fresh water w/ citrus fruit in the lobby, as I was doing a lot of walking during my stay. Sure, areas could use a refresh here and there, such as areas of my restroom, caulk work, old mirror, etc, but it was clean and it's to be expected in an older 3 star hotel. My bed was clean and very comfortable, the towels were thick and soft, and I had four plump pillows. I loved the adjustable shower head, it relieved sore muscles from toting my backpack all day. I had all I needed for a short stay. I stayed on Mon-Tues night and the hall was quiet at night. I really enjoyed the rooftop terrace, it had a great view. Everyone working at the hotel was kind and helpful, and I especially enjoyed the bag check before check-in time. I was a little concerned about being charged for incidentals and then being refunded if there were no incidentals, I'd never experienced that before. Usually the card is just kept on file for incidentals, so I'll have to check that it is refunded. The hotel is in a great location; walking distance to the Red Line, Navy Pier, a block from MI Ave, and near many shops and restaurants. I had no complaints!

102,"This hotel is the real life 'hotel Transylvania'. If you check into a room, you may see such things as bodily fluids (not yours) dirty clothes (again, not yours) and wonder when the last time the sheets have been changed. If you bring this up to the front desk, they will helpfully let you know that the room cleaners have a union, that they have reported deficiencies to the union rep, and there's nothing else that can be done.

They were really accommodating, with helpful and friendly staff, and we were able to get a room for both nights at a really reasonable price. Location was super convenient. It was a great stay!

104,I stayed in the hotel for 1 week. Check in went smooth. All the facilities were available and no questions as it should be in a good place. As an extra you may refuse from daily cleaning and earn 5$ card for a day. These cards you may send to buy some drinks in hotel bar. Check out was fast as a wind. The location is amazing - close the city center office and main attractions.

That's where u spend your time is the bed, woke up with back not feeling good with wore out bed.

107,"So, as I read the mixed reviews, I completely get it. The first night our flight got in very late. Although we paid for queen, we were given a subpar “two twin” room (they were actually doubles but so tiny and horrible mattresses) Again we prepaid for queens. I called to the front desk and was informed due to my late arrival which they were made aware of, we got what was left. I called down the next morning and asked to be moved once rooms opened up. They promptly took care of us and put us into a corner suite with the proper size bed. Now this room was an extreme contrast to the other. Although the carpet and couch were a little worse for the wear, everything else was great. Perfect location to walk around. I would stay here again.

108,I stayed here with some friends in July 18'. Nice hotel with cosy rooms. The beds were very comfortable. Pleasant stay overall and would recommend. Location is ideal just off Michigan Avenue.

110,"Location is great next to Michigan Avenue - the hotel has an history apparently - but well frankly you cannot feel it upon checkin - it's just an average property - rooms are OK with nothing special - lifts are quite slow and breakfast un the morning is excellent but you have to queue before being seated because the staff takes you to your table one by one, which is not very effective when it's busy. Otherwise little to say - and I left a litlle bit disapointed because I was expecting something with a soul (such as the Congress Plaza for instance old, outdated, haunted, but with a je ne sais quoi unique). The Warwick is just average hotel with good breakfast and good location in downtown Chicago.",3-Jul-19,Warwick Allerton-Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90973-Reviews-Warwick_Allerton_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
111,"From check in to check out what an experience. Before I start let me say we know check in is at 4. We arrived early due to an early morning flight and upon checking in we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite. What they did not tell us was that the suites were the last room to be released. We were told they would call when the room was ready. After lunch I rechecked and was told 2:30 and she could not promise to call that she might be busy. Checked at 2:30 and was told close to 4:00 and he would call. At 3:30 got into the long line to check to be told our room would not be ready till close to 5:00. She also informed me again that check in is at 4:00 it’s 3:45. Well by now I am aggravated and just want a room. We had to be at an event at 6. She said she did not see an issue would be in our room at 5. She also checkin started at 4 not was at 4. Well I wanted to speak to a manger and all the sudden she put us in a room. A small room on a bottom floor. I paid for a King deluxe on a high floor. I called the desk and got her. She again was rude and had an attitude told me it’s 3:47 and check in is at 4:00. I demanded an manger but she gave me another person at the desk he apologized and said to come back down and pick up a diffent key. They did put us in a different room across the hall with a view of a brink wall in one room and the air unit in the other. It was a 2 room suite but was by no way a upgrade than what I paid for. The carpet was stained, the walls dirty and the bed headboard stained and ripped. Only one small mirror in the bathroom. Never like getting ready with a hand mirror.Finally spoke to a manger after we checked out 2 days later. She said she wished she could have spoken to me whilewe were there. I guess she should have made an effort. I thought she said would refund half of our stay but that was not quite what she did. If we had just been told that our room would not be ready to 5:00 we would have thanked them for the offer but taken the room we paid for. Please note that other guest were getting room keys during the 4 hours we sat in the dirty lobby.",3-Jul-19,Warwick Allerton-Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90973-Reviews-Warwick_Allerton_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
112,"We loved the location of this hotel. Our room vas very quiet and had a great view. I want to especially acknowledge Alex, the front desk clerk. He absolutely went out of his way to help us store our 2 large kayaks which would not fit in the parking garage on top of our vehicle. They had to be carried up 3 floors. I also want to thank the doorman, Nurrie, he was so helpful in helping up depart--again with our kayaks.

113,"Location of the hotel is excellent and is perfect for exploring the city. The look of the hotel from the outside shows it is an older hotel and the reception area has a lot of character. Check in was not great; two staff were trying to sort out an issue on a call and the other was busying herself doing something else. Our room was horrendous! It was small and felt unclean. We were staying for 4 nights and I had nowhere to unpack my clothes; I ended up with my underwear on top of the safe as there were no drawers. There was no bedside cabinet on one side, partly because there was no space so it was impossible to get out of the bed on the other side. There were 2 windows, both of which had a terrible view. The carpet was dirty and overall the room felt mucky. Check out was equally as bad; we were never asked about our stay and the person was so distracted, she didn't even ask our room number to begin with. Would only recommend for location, but would rather pay slightly more for a better hotel room.",23-Jun-19,Warwick Allerton-Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90973-Reviews-Warwick_Allerton_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

116,"Terrible place to stay. The property is a historic building which we liked but had a number of issues. At check in the lady with the white streak was robotic. Not welcoming and wouldnt even look me in the eye. The room smelled pretty bad. At night I asked where I could find a vending machine. I was directed to the only one which was broken. When asked for another machine I was told to go to Walgreens. They could have simply sent a bottle of water to take care of their guest. When I asked to speak to the manager on duty I was given the run around but two different ladies (Victoria and Alicia both kind and helpful) tried to help at the front desk. They gave me vouchers for breakfast, a $5 bottle of wine, and a few drink vouchers for the bar. Was also told they would send some sweets for my wife and I but that never showed up. When we tried to redeem the drink vouchers the short African American manager gave us a difficult time. The best thing about this hotel were the servers at breakfast both Raul and Guadalupe were amazingly kind, attentive, and just awesome people.

But there's no room service menu in the room.....$19.99 for on demand movies that are ""still in theaters."" If they're still in theaters, you can see them for less than $19.99, at the theater. $9.99 for movies that you can get on google play or itunes for $3.99.Surprised they don't charge for the ice machine.Check-in staff was the opposite of friendly.They market themselves as a luxury hotel, but there is no luxury here.Street performers operate on Michigan ave until past midnight.

131,"For us this was a good location. It is about a mile walk to Old Town Chicago to the north and a mile walk to River Walk area to the South. If walking isn't your thing, the buses were easy to navigate too. Our doorman when we arrives, John, was very helpful about getting us situated and getting our car parked. When we left our doorman Nurrie was also very helpful. The man who brought our car around gave us good directions for navigation our way out of town through busy traffic. The room #715 was spacious...a sitting area was an added bonus so we felt less like a hotel then a small studio. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant and accommodating as well. The one fault was the refrigerator...it is tucked into cabinet which did not allow for heat circulation from the refrig motor, so it never got cold. We wound up leaving the cabinet door ajar which helped. Also the carpet in the room was a bit worn, but the bath and towels were great and the bed very comfortable. The buffet breakfast looked great, but we opted to order off the menu. Either way it was a bit expensive. There are numerous other options in the area if cost is an issue.

134,"they charge every guest's credit card $60 A DAY for incidentals at the desk when you check in, and this is a hotel with no mini bar, nothing in your fridge, not even a bottle of water in your room. even if you bring your employer's card to the desk, they won't accept it unless your boss is standing there with you. you need to fill out an authorization form like you're getting a visa to a foreign country. it will take 3-5 (or 7) business days to recoup the money, so they're holding hundreds of dollars of your money for basically a week even if you don't get a penny's worth of incidentals. when you ask them about this, they argue with you and indicate that you're being rude. if there were a bottle of water even in the room, maybe i'd accept this but there’s nothing except empty glasses. btw the food at the bar is HORRIBLE, probably the worst i've eaten and i'm not even a picky eater. ""french onion soup"" = a bowl of lipton onion soup heated in a microwave with half a slice of supermarket mozzarella melted on it. they didnt offer a piece of bread, even, and the bartender was completely indifferent. so I ate and drank all my meals and drinks at the Omni hotel bar one block away where the staff was courteous and the menu was good. this is sad because the cleaning staff are incredibly nice. i left big tips for them. but everyone at every desk is indifferent, and if you raise any fuss, condescending. stay at the Omni or any other hotel instead.",20-May-19,Warwick Allerton-Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90973-Reviews-Warwick_Allerton_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

Sang at an appropriate level and played some of my favorite songs. Several issues: My husband ran downstairs one more to grab a cup of coffee and a diet coke. They did not have change for a $10, so a black cup of coffee and diet coke cost us $10. Second, the rooms are kind of small (not an issue as we only sleep in the room), but the bed was SUPER tiny. It was a full bed that was super short. I am 5'4"" and my feet were all the way to the end. My husband is 6' and was not comfortable at all.

He immediately put us in another room and had us moved.. We even told him that we were fine but he would NOT accept that. Just top notch.Then there is our favorite server in the restaurant, Guadalupe. She is so pleasant.. And I mean all the time.. She is wonderful. You know how you stay at some places and the servers act like it is a hassle to help you, not Guadalupe.. Really no one here acts like that.Our room was cleaned by Gilda..

142,"We stayed at the Warwick for 3 nights. the location was wonderful for getting around and seeing the sights and just walking the city. in the restaurant Raul took very good care of us every morning for breakfast. He was friendly, helpful with ideas and nice to talk too. Calling housekeeping was another thing. We opted not to have them make up our room however, we needed to replenish coffee and some toiletries. I called them twice and both times you would think I was asking them to remodel my room.

145,"First, Gilda the housekeeper was fantastic. A ball of energy who bent over backwards to ensure that our room was clean every day. She's an asset to the Warwick company.My son and I stayed for 4 nights for a spring break getaway. The Warwick Allerton is everything one would expect of a high quality urban hotel. We received excellent service from the moment we arrived from a highly competent and well-trained staff. The room wasn't luxurious, but it had no deficiencies. Perfectly clean, more spacious than one might expect from a historic hotel, and well appointed, with a comfortable bed, coffee maker, a desk and chair. I'm particularly fond of hotels that have clothes lines in the shower, and the Allerton had one.

147,"We stayed at the Warwick hotel for couple of days for a fun weekend in Chicago and we had a wonderful experience. Not only the hotel is located in a very cool area but it also is a very good place to stay during your visit to the Windy City. The rooms are very clean and well laid out, the fitness center has everything you need for a good workout and the staff is extremely friendly and very professional. Chef Concierge, Mr. Bouchaib Oumelaz, was very attentive and helpful during our stay. From the moment we checked in he gave us very good recommendations for where to eat, what to do and where to go for us to have a great time in Chicago. Breakfast was delicious! Waiters Raul and Guadalupe were very friendly and made our “first meal of the day” very special. They provided us good service and a friendly smile, what better way to start your day!

149,"Rarely have I had a room so bad that I insisted on switching. The primary problem with this hotel is the elevators, which are loud, slow, and directly outside MANY guest rooms, which makes sleep impossible.But the rooms themselves are quite neglected. My first room (1822) was dark, awkwardly shaped (you'll see), with a clogged shower drain and no shower shelf for soap.My second room (2202) had a shower that drained and a shower-shelf, and was away from the elevators, but had a broken fluorescent light in the bathroom, and no window curtains (near other high-rises).There is no lobby in this hotel, just a restaurant and a couch, so no place to sit or meet colleagues. It's just way below any other 4-star hotel.I would never go back. The ONLY bright spot was a housekeeper named ""Gilda"" (pronounced ""Hilda"") who was the most cheerful, outgoing, and friendly hotel staff I have ever met.

157,"I was ready to give Warwick Allerton Hotel Chicago a good rating when I checked in on March 9, 2019. My room was larger than it was when I stayed in March 2018, and I was generally pleased. To the readers of this review, I would like for you to keep 2 things in mind: 1) Employees who are public facing become the brand stewards of the organization whether they like it or not, and consumers associate their experiences sometimes solely on their interactions with the organization’s employees 2) I had a valid, already authorized credit card on file.I checked into the Warwick Allerton Chicago on Saturday, March 9th around 10 PM. I made a reservation for 2 nights through Hotel Tonight, paid in advance, and had the receipt in addition to the confirmation within the app. When I checked in, the front desk person said she only had me for one night. I showed her the app, the email receipt, checked in, gave my credit card and ID, and I also told her that I would contact Hotel Tonight when I settled in my room to make sure they resolved the reservation. Through the app, I did a live chat, and Hotel Tonight contacted the hotel to resolve. The Hotel Tonight rep replied back, told me who they spoke with, and we were both under the impression that the matter was resolved.Sunday, March 10th, I went downstairs, bought breakfast, and went for a walk. I had dinner scheduled with some friends later that evening, so I came back to my room to take a nap. A housekeeper knocked on my door around 2PM and said, “You’re not checking out,” and I said, “I booked for 2 nights.” Two hours later, I am napping well, and the landline in the room was ringing. I missed the call, but did not think much of it. Ten-minutes later there was a knock at the door – hotel security. Perplexed as I was when I saw them, one of them (they sent 2!) said I only had the room for one night. I grabbed my phone, read the message from Hotel Tonight, confirmed that they did have an employee with the name the Hotel Tonight rep referenced Saturday night, and they confirmed. I told them I would contact Hotel Tonight again just to verify, they left.Ten-minutes later, they’re back – both of them. Their posture was far beyond impolite and unprofessional; it was tantamount to, “you’re not squatting in this room tonight!” Now I’m simply offended by now, I opened the door, said I am coming down, slammed it back, and got dressed. In a parental/patriarchal way, security guard one, admonished me. I get to the front desk, I show the receipt and the conformation in the app, and then the front desk clerk wants to show me his computer screen, but why should I care about his screen! I have been doing my job (guest), and his (clerk). By now, I am now Hotel Tonight. When I got them on the phone they were on top of the situation. By now, I am beyond annoyed.After Hotel Tonight spoke with the front desk clerk, I went back to the room – I was locked out! I called Hotel Tonight back, described the situation and the rep told me that the hotel offered me free breakfast the next day for this incidence. I told Hotel Tonight that since I bought the $25 breakfast that morning; I did not want that because it paled in comparison to the impact the hotel had had on me thus far. While waiting to get back into my room, some “manager” person came to speak to me with such a soft voice, that she actual prompted me to reach my highest point of annoyance, and I could not wait to get out of that hotel. Hotel Tonight agreed with my conclusion to leave, got me back into my room to pack my bag, I made a reservation at a nearby Hyatt through the app, Hotel refunded both nights’ room and tax, and I had a good dinner with friends.Here’s the take away. There were multiple points of failure in this situation. First, the front desk clerk who spoke with Hotel Tonight on Saturday evening failed to do her job. She failed to note the information for the next person’s shift to keep information continuity. Second, the hotel security is in desperate need of training including unconscious bias training – they should not be public facing. Third, the afternoon front desk person who showed me his computer screen that Sunday – he should not be public facing. He needs extensive training in brand stewardship and conflict resolution. Finally, manager lady, who attempted, but failed, to present a calming and accommodating persona to me should have used that energy to insist that her colleagues resolve the situation immediately! Matter of fact, she should have been on the phone with Hotel Tonight. Never AGAIN! There are too many options and tons of competition in the hospitality industry. You can take your chances that you too may be served by some of these people on duty March 9th – 10th, but you’ve been warned.",15-Apr-19,Warwick Allerton-Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90973-Reviews-Warwick_Allerton_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
158,"During my previous stay in Chicago, I stayed at a hotel that had a club/lounge vibe. Let's just say that it only worked for the time because I happen to have to be in Chicago during the polar vortex in Feb 2019. Otherwise, I am so HAPPY to have found the Warwick Allerton! Who knew? The hotel definitely has some history and is retro in design/aesthetics, I loved it. Also, 5-STARs on the water pressure, comfort of the bed, especially the food and wonderful service at the restaurant. When I book next for work in Chicago, the Warwick Allerton will be where I check first. I see why they have repeat/loyal customers and long-standing staff.

I’d recommend the place and would likely stay there again. Just keep in mind this is not a chain location like Holiday Day Inn Express.

At the end of the day, we went to the lobby and finally they magically find 7 extra beds and they sent the beds at our room at 2am on my wedding day!

166,"My husband and I and another couple recently stayed at the Palmer house from July 4-7. Our confirmation # is 3535289690. I’m sorry to say we were not impressed with the service. My husband is a Hilton Honors member. Because it was chaotic at check-in, we went to the Honors line but were told unless we were Diamond or Platinum, we couldn’t use that line even though there was no one in line. We checked in on our phone and were then “allowed” to use the honors line. Two people at the desk were talking so after a minute or so when my husband said “excuse me”, one of them said “I’m training this person, I’ll be with you in a minute”!We checked in and went to our “hip and historic” 2 bedroom suite. Although large, the living area was very cold and uninviting. It could use something to “warm” it up.We went down to the bar which was crowded with only 1 server! We found a table that was bussed by the people leaving the table because they told us it was never cleaned before they sat down. We had to flag down a server several times before we were served.All these things made our visit less than enjoyable. However, the most surprising thing follows. On our first morning, I called room service at 8 am to order coffee and muffins only to be told room service hours started at 5pm! We couldn’t believe that the Palmer House didn’t have morning room service. I then asked for a coffee pot and was told one could be sent up at 5pm when room service began!! I was told, “we don’t have anyone to bring one to you now”! I was surprised there was no coffee pot in the room and was told, “we have over 1200 rooms and we can’t put coffee pots in each one”! So Hilton Garden Inns can have coffee pots but NOT Palmer House?!We were so disappointed in our stay at the Palmer House which touts itself as “one of the finest hotels” in America. We will not be returning to the Palmer House although we have friends and family in Chicago and will certainly discourage our friends and family from staying there. It’s sad that a fine old hotel has lost its drive for fine service.Claudia Sokolowski",9-Jul-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

The room we had was really big, huge walk in closet and quiet, I never heard corridor noise from other guests. It does lack some basics: no free WiFi access. We were begrudgingly given an access code due to issues with validating a Hilton Honors account. No shower gel, we had to go buy some. No coffee machine in the room until we mentioned this in the txt message feedback request (which is an excellent idea and the hotel staff responded very quickly to our concerns on this).

172,"Years ago, while staying at a grand downtown city hotel, we found an ""evaluation sheet"" left behind by a former guest, in which the guest described her disappointment at the hotel being ""too old and elegant"". Her last sentence was ""... we were expecting something like Las Vegas..."".Well, Palmer House remains old and elegant, and is certainly not Las Vegas. There is very little to add to my review of 2017. The hotel remains in good condition, and is very well maintained. The lobby is monumental, but the service is slow. The staff, as in any major city, tends to be indifferent or impersonal. (Stay at Hampton Inns in rural or suburban Pennsylvania, for example, if you want to see friendly staff.) The rooms are traditional, if not dated, and the closet and bathroom doors appear to be original to the building. The elevators work, as well as the computers and printers in the executive center.The continental breakfast is fine. Hot items, like pancakes or omelettes, are $8.00 extra. Attention: when you check in, make sure that you ask the agent whether you are listed for full or continental breakfast, or no breakfast at all. Do not get distracted by their offering of free water. The windowless breakfast area remains as dismal as ever.Parking at 55 East Monroe Street, on the other side of the diabolical elevated tracks of ""The Loop"", is convenient. Bring your parking ticket to the hotel to be added to your room bill at a modest discount. ($50/day is the usual rate.) When you leave, take your validated ticket with you and just insert the end with the bar code into the reader controlling the arm. The machine will not swallow your ticket, just read the bar code and lift the arm. If you try to stuff the ticket into the machine, like most of us are used to doing, you will be frustrated.Downtown Chicago expressways are being destroyed and rebuilt, and your GPS may not have all the updates necessary to find your destination. It may be wise to leave the freeways before you reach ""The Loop"", and complete your approach via city streets, for which you might need (God forbid!) a map. Yes, the Palmer House is old and elegant, but nowadays a lot of its clientele is not. Distressed jeans, T-shirts and flip-flops abound, together with duffel bags and napsacks. The lobby remains a favorite place to have a glass of wine late at night, when Hamilton is over and the Wal-Mart crowds have retired.Palmer House is generally comfortable and well appointed. Its location is most convenient to many Chicago attractions and businesses. Obtaining a taxi is easy. You pay a competitive rate for a grand downtown hotel.But it is not Las Vegas.",5-Jul-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

178,"the public spaces are beautiful and the staff incredibly accommodating. It is worth sacrificing on dates bathrooms for a great location. We were able to walk of UBER to everything we wanted to.

179,"My husband and I stayed here one night for a quick getaway. From the moment we arrived, everyone on staff was enthusiastic to greet us and very helpful. We arrived before check-in but there was no problem storing our luggage. When we did check in, the reservations agent who assisted us upgraded our room, permitted a late check-out of 1pm, and gave us free bottled waters. What a wonderful first impression it made in addition to the magnificent beauty of the hotel in general. We were provided a room on the top floor. As soon as we opened the door, the room smelled fresh and inviting. We entered a sitting area with a TV and walked a short hallway to the main bedroom. It was bright and beautifully decorated. There was a minibar and snacks for purchase available. The bathroom included a tub and shower combination. The bed was comfortable and it was just a lovely room to be in. The location of the hotel was perfect for us and the self-parking was possibly the least expensive of most hotels at $47/day with in/out privileges. Lockwood Restaurant and Bar is in the lobby and a variety of shops are just below on the street level, including Starbucks. I highly recommend this hotel as we will definitely be back hopefully before summer ends.

180,"A little disappointed, The hotel is nice and the staff are very friendly but upon returning after a day out we found our honor bar door ajar. I tried several times to get it to close to no avail. I rearranged bottles(big mistake)finally when I gave up , returned all bottles to original position and settled with leaning a pillow on the bar door to keep it closed. Shortly after I discovered someone's snack uneaten on the dresser(I think housekeeping struggled and gave up and forgot to take their snack when they left). Next morning when I was reviewing my invoice I had been charged for liquor. When I informed front desk, they said they would take care of it but I have yet to be emailed the updated receipt so I now have to take time to pursue that issue.",1-Jul-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

It is a grand hotel for lack of a better term, where they have a majestic lobby that is great to see. Location is great for downtown attractions, also right by a loop stop. The walls do however seem on the thin side. I didn't have a problem, but some of the other reviews seem to indicate they had problems.The price is also pretty good for a downtown hotel as well.

Other than that, our hip and historic room was great and large.When we checked in, they were unable to make keys for rooms due to some computer problem. A hotel staff member opened the room for us initially. We were given a master key later that afternoon and was told not to lose it, only key! The problem was not corrected until later the next day! Over 24 hours! All of the hotel staff were great though. Everyone was very helpful and hotel is in a great location! The hotel bar-Potter’s was great!

185,"There was a bit of confusion at check-in when the lady checking us in told us we had only pre paid for one room, not two. After 10 minutes of waiting we were informed that it was the way one of her colleagues had set up the booking and that the rooms were pre paid. The rooms are small with no tea/coffee facilities. Behind the fridge/t.v stand the place was thick of dust and hadn't been cleaned in weeks. There is also a very expensive mini bar and an in room safe. Inside the hotel there is an array of different shops. The hotel has a fabulous history with huge mega stars having performed here over the years, this is reflected in the pictures which adorn the walls. The hotel has an excellent location within the loop, not far from Grant park, The Cloud and is right next door to the Hamilton theatre. Just a short walk from the entrance is the start of the historic route 66. At check-out we were informed there was nothing to pay, but unfortunately when we returned home and checked our account the hotel had taken $725 out of our account and attempted to take another $1300.

186,I was here for business and glad I wasn’t here for vacation. The hotel is nice in the common areas. However you have to understand how to enter from street-level and go up to check in. I was hoping the rooms would be better. However I found them very small and dated. There was no coffee maker in the room. There was Very little room to move around in the room and The bathroom was very tiny. Room service doesn’t open till 5 o’clock so don’t think you can get coffee in your room even delivered. You have to go down to Starbucks in the main lobby. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel but if you want to see a theater show it is in good proximity to Hamilton and others.I wished I could write it higher it’s just OK and that’s because of the rooms. The staff is nice and the common areas and that is the only reason it’s a three. Or I would’ve made it lower,26-Jun-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
187,"Beautiful hotel. Great central location to trains, buses, parks, museums, restaurants and everything in between. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our flight arrived early in the morning. We took the Blue Line from O’Hare to the hotel (about 30 minutes). We dropped off our luggage very quickly and were on our way! Check in was quick as well. We were asked whether we wanted a room near the elevator or not – we chose not! Our room was on the 20th floor. The room was very quiet and we didn’t hear any noise. We gave our checked luggage tags to the person checking us in and our luggage was brought up in less than 15 minutes. The room was spacious and clean. Nice size TV for a hotel! The bathroom was a bit tight. The toilet paper holder (double roll) banged against my shoulder and ribs when I used the toilet. Sink area was small as well. There was a small walk-in closet. Wish the closet was smaller and the bathroom was larger. We had the “bed and breakfast” package. Breakfast was the buffet ($30/pp) in the Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby. Ample choices – food and service were very good. The bed was comfortable. Not very soft, more on the firm side. I’ve slept in worse; I’ve slept in better. Pet peeve – small/standard pillows on a king bed. Sleeping with small pillows are not very comfortable for me. (I usually bring my own or end up buying one!) The comforter (down or sim.) was nice and warm.There was a “Do not Disturb sign,” but no “Please clean room” sign. It would be helpful to have to let the room attendants know you are not in the room and they can make it up while it is unoccupied. One day we came back in the mid afternoon and it was still not attended to although we had left before they even started cleaning. There was a mini fridge in the room, but you could not use it. It was full of beverages you could purchase. There was also a tray of snacks on the fridge for sale. I wish I had use of the fridge for my own beverages/food. I got a good rate for my room (with breakfast). If I had paid too much, I might not have been that satisfied. Overall, I had a great stay here and would recommend this hotel.",23-Jun-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

This was a sold out weekend, come on Hilton what were you thinking? Also our room was to close to the elevators and we could hear them all night long. Extremely noisy. Rooms were comfortable, but small. That's to be expected in an older hotel in a large city. Besides we weren't in Chicago to sit in a hotel room. We I say here again-yes,I would just make sure my room wasn't by the elevators. The location of the this hotel is perfect.

190,"This is a beautiful property; the oldest continuously operating hotel in the U.S. So, historically, there is so much to see and appreciate; but it is the location that is the real prize. The lobby and ballrooms are jaw-dropping. The Lockwood bar within the lobby is just a fantastic place to have a drink, surf the net, or get a meal. But that ceiling, alone, will keep you transfixed, in addition to the mouldings, frescoes, and everything else historic and beautiful. The rooms are dated. Bathrooms and internet are just fine; but my mattress was way too soft, and getting to the closet required blocking off access to the other side of the room. My view was non-existent. There are no refrigerators, coffee makers or microwaves, which is disappointing. Saying that, when you have 270+ restaurants with a half mile of the hotel, and Starbucks, Freshii, and the Corner Bakery within the hotel, you won't want for anything. I loved the old elevators, and the historic photos on every floor of the stars of film and stage who have played at the Palmer. The Burger Bar is stylish and beautifully lit; good for a drink, but useless for a vegan. The Lockwood is very expensive, but friends said the food was incredible. The only real negatives are as follows: there was a line-up of at least an hour to check in on the Saturday, which we avoided arriving on a Friday. And the pool and fitness centre are under construction, and have been for a very long time. How long does it take to renovate a pool? Seriously. Having to go off-site is not a good solution. Despite those criticisms, I loved the place. Right in the Loop, across from the 'El', a 5 minute walk to Millennium Park and the Magnificent Mile, and a short cab or transit ride to Museum Campus - this location cannot be beat. I hope the Palmer is still with us in the next century.",21-Jun-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
191,"I'll start by saying the the location of the hotel is great and the lobby is truly beautiful. Otherwise I think it's an ""ok"" hotel. The rooms are clean but a little dated. The check-in process was terrible. There was always an extremely long line at the front desk, which moved very slowly. The front desk staff was not even minimally friendly. At 11am on the third day of my stay I checked out of one room after my conference and prechecked into another room. I got a key and the floor number and was told that I would get a text with the new room #. By 3:30 (check in time is 3), no text, so I went back to the lobby. About 100 people on line waiting to check in. Asked concierge if they could help me find my room number, they just said no. I called the hotel on the phone and was told I had a room assigned but it was not cleaned yet so she couldn't give me the number. She would ask them to clean my room next and would text me when it was ready. An hour later I still hadn't heard back from her. (By the way, why the concierge couldn't make the same call I made is unclear.) I got back on the check-in line again. As soon as I got to the front she gave me my room #. Apparently my room was ready by nobody could take a moment to text me. She said the reason for the delay was that the key system wasn't working. I told her I already had a key but she, literally, just sort of shrugged and didn't even try to answer. I was in the hotel a total of six nights (3 days for business and then another 3 with my husband). Every staff member I interacted with, from the front desk, to the operator, to the bar tender, gave me the impression that I was an inconvenience.",20-Jun-19,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d111501-Reviews-Palmer_House_A_Hilton_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

I was informed the phone was not in the room and it had been checked. Then later that night I received a call that it was found. Manager was defensive and said they aren't responsible for items in hotel. Nine days later, it's not been mailed, calls not returned, and no explanation of how it was found. Manager was rude.

There were probably 50 people in the lounge. It surprised me that drinks weren't restocked without being asked. The website advertised Netflix. The TV remote had a button for it, but it did nothing.

The windows were bolted shut and looked out over a dirty alleyway with a brick wall just a few feet across. The two beds were terribly saggy. The bathroom floor tile was loose and slanted. I went back down to the front desk and let the man at the desk know that I wouldn't be staying, as the room was not up to my expectations. He was outwardly polite but clearly irritated with me. He took my key back and told me that I would not be charged. He would not provide me with a receipt as I had not stayed.I arrived home to find that the entire amount was charged to my card, almost $400. I am now in a process with Travelodge by Wyndham to return my $400. Incidentally, I found the Palmer Hotel about a mile down the road for a much lower rate and the room was very clean and felt safe.

In addition, the curtains don't cover the window so as soon as the sun comes up, the room lights up. There is very little water pressure so the shower is a trickle.

The food in the little cafe was very good and reasonably priced. The staff at the hotel desk were not helpful at all. When we asked a question - the answer was I don't know.

239,"We travel a great deal and this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in anywhere in the world.To begin with the room was extremely noisy with a train running outside our window at all times of the day and night. This made any kind of rest impossible. When we asked for a different room at the front desk, our concerns were dismissed and we were given instead two pairs of very flimsy earplugs which were totally ineffective. Some warning in advance would have been helpful so we could make an informed decision as to whether to stay. In addition, the room was dirty and the sheets stained. Moreover, the curtains did not cover the whole window so that light came in from below and rest was difficult.The bathroom was also dingy and unpleasant to use. Worst of all, there was what appeared to be mold around the air conditioner in the window which we did not realize until the morning.

254,This is my first negative review of a Wyndham hotel. This hotel is located downtown in a very old building that not only made loud noises through out the night when the heat kicked on but there is also a train very close by so if you are looking to get s peaceful sleep I would suggest earplugs. To be honest those issues were minimal but the room did not appear to be cleaned before our arrival and the sink in the washroom was unhinged from the wall do when I leaned against it to wash my hands I had to catch it otherwise half of the sink was falling sideways and when I turned on the faucet water splattered from the pipes below. I called the front desk on our way home and was told by the front desk someone would check into this. I never heard back butvassumed because it was the holidays that it would take some time. When I got this survey I did not immediately give my opinion I decided to contact Wyndham direct and my main reason for contacting them is I thought this was a safety issue. If a small child had leaned against that sink it could have fell on them and injured them. Wyndham gave me a file number and said they would contact the hotel and also get back to me. I never heard from them. I finally contacted them and was told this hotel denied anything being wrong with the room let alone sink and that I never called the front desk. Basically calling me a liar. I was very disappointed in both the way the hotel itself and Wyndham handled this issue. I have been. Wyndham rewards member since 2007 and as I stated I have never had to give a bad review but this hotel deserved one. It’s sad because I wasn’t looking for a refund only thinking about the safety aspect of it. ,12-Jan-19,Travelodge by Wyndham Downtown Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87576-Reviews-Travelodge_by_Wyndham_Downtown_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

257,"I cannot quite express how diabolically antiquated the hotel is. I was first greeted by one receptionist who clearly had better things to do than tend to my check-in after my 17 hour flight inbound and raced through everything like a machine to send me on my way. At least it was efficient.I tend got into this lift that looked like it was as old as the city itself (a recurring theme in this hotel). The walls of the lift clearly were damaged enough, I suppose, that they had to put this sort of canvas on top of them to make it look nicer (it didn’t because that too has holes in it).When I got into my room on the fourth floor, what lay in front of me was something out of a bad hotel hell episode. The windows, despite facing the metro line right in front of the hotel, were barely shut (forget double glazing), and let the freezing Chicago air and metro noise in like they were open. That’s okay, because the heating, one of these ancient radiators, was stuck open. Despite the notice that explains how to use these pieces of history, you could not turn the thing off if you tried. Therefore the room was absolutely boiling. Which meant I had to turn the air conditioning on, which is wonderfully eco friendly and again added to the superb ambiance brought by the metro and the clicking and clanging radiator pipes (these were LOUD). As I went to bed cursing my company for sending me to such a hell hole for my 3-day business in Chicago, I was presented with my piece de resistance, in the form of the dirtiest floor I’ve ever seen in a hotel. Amongst a sea of other particles which I dare not speculate as to what origin they where, was a nail shaving from a previous customer. Right there. Right next to my feet as I got in bed. The place is absolutely diabolical and if you have a choice, any choice, other than this, I suggest you elect to not come here. If you do have to come here, come prepared with ear-plugs, strong soap, and a pre-diminished level of dignity.

259,"As I was preparing to check out on a weekday morning, I scanned the room to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything (I was wrong). I then hurried off to the convention center for a morning symposium. On the way ,I realized that I had, in fact, left something behind in my haste. After the first session, I called to report the problem. Eric rushed up to my 12th story room and retrieved the item while I waited on hold, then stored it until I was able to return later that afternoon. His prompt action was critical, because the forgotten item could’ve easily been discarded by the housekeeping staff, since it didn’t look important or valuable. Thanks again, Eric! You and your staff earned a five-star rating for helpfulness and friendliness. Btw, the pipes DO bang and the “L” is nearby. So what? I don’t live there; I needed a place to sleep and shower.

This leaves all conversations had on the streets feeling like they are in your room, not to mention whatever weather that is outside is felt inside. The L is passing adjacent to the hotel, so you get to listen to that all night too. The window curtain was not long enough to cover the window, so blocking out the light of the city was not an option.

261,DO NOT STAY HERE. Noisiest hotel!!! The boiling plumbing pipes which run inside your room make the loudest noise ALL night. Then add to this the train only 100m away. Several complaints to hotel management and the answer is “it’s an old hotel” It sounds like someone smashing on the wall continually. Been here 3 nights in 3 rooms unable to sleep it really is that loud. Staff are rude and unwelcoming. And rooms haven’t been cleaned properly.

Easy accessible with local amenities and excellent area down to Michigan avenue, millennium Park and Navy pier.The bad partRadiator in the room was crazy loud, banging every 25 minutes and Diggle glazed windows meant that the ""L"" train which runs through the city non stop 24 hours kept us awake every night. We used the hotel for what it was, a place to sleep.Was relatively cheap considering some of the other prices, but we left very tired and unrested indeed.The area is apparently going to be demolished according to locals, so maybe the problems we had won't be solved anytime soon, sad really because the hotel has lots of potential for its location.

I just like the layout in the room and all that as well. The rooms are spacious, and contain the necessary equipment for you to have a pleasant stay. The bed is so good, and the bathroom is fine. The hotel also has two diners in the ground level, that you could go and eat. Both of those are very good.The customer service of this hotel is exceptional. They are very friendly.

284,"I was here for a conference in June and the hotel perfectly suited that purpose. The meeting rooms were nice, though a bit cold. I appreciated there always being water, coffee, tea, etc. The breakfast was really good, but I wished they had provided oatmeal every day. It was perfect and really tasty. Even though our room was only on the 10th floor we had a great view. However, the room faced the afternoon sun so the blinds had to remain closed most of the day or else it was unbearably hot. The AC could not keep up with the heat radiating through the big glass windows. The room was a nice size but had a few odd features. The closet bar was arranged front to back instead of horizontally so you couldn't fit much in there. My husband arrived after I was there 2 days and it was hard to fit clothes for both of us, esp. with the ironing board and iron also taking up space. The bathroom was kind of small and didn't have a lot of counter space, but at least you could use the shelf underneath. The shower was great with good water pressure but definitely needs more shelving for toiletries. We had to put our stuff on the floor. Housekeeping was very good, Staff were really nice and most seemed to genuinely care about your comfort. Shout out to Marlon who brought me extra towels my first night. Bellman were excellent as well.The little cafe/store in the lobby had some nice healthy options, but the prices were astronomical for what you got. It was worth walking 2 blocks to the grocery store for provisions. We didn't try the restaurant or bar because the location of the hotel was right in the middle of everything.

Of course I did so, but began to have a sense of doom. At 1 hour, I went downstairs and after speaking to 5 different people, was led to a room loaded top to bottom with undelivered (or undeliverable?) bags. Mine were all together in a corner.

The lobby bar has no table service so you have to go battle for a bartender’s attention to get a drink and take it back to your spot. Service is limited. No water in my room despite Platinum status so I had to go buy it for $6 in the lobby. The room renovation was fine and my room was quiet. The location is great.

303,"What we have come to expect from Marriott. The hotel was beautiful, lobby was gorgeous and huge! Room was nice. GREAT location, can walk to really almost anything you want to in downtown Chicago. The only problem we had wasn't with the hotel but the Valet service. They dinged my back bumper and basically gave us the non stop run around until we have finally given up trying to get them to assist in repairs. (Car was 2 weeks old, there was no previous crack in the bumper). I would suggest skipping this service and parking in the garage across the street yourself. It is the same lot. I also was a little annoyed that they would not allow us to have a baggage cart ourselves to load our luggage ourselves. They insisted on a bell boy to do it. Minor issue, but irritating when we were in a bit of a hurry to get to Easter mass.",16-May-19,Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Chicago_Marriott_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
304,Stay away if you like a cool room - they completely shut the A/C off. 75 degree room. But you can open the window and be soothed to sleep by the gentle sound of car horns Seems right.

305,"Nice hotel with even nicer staff. No pool but there’s a pool in the photos. Bummer. Clean room and hotel in general, quick elevators, good food. Valet was pricey at 61 per day.

307,"Room was too hot and would not go below 72 degrees, the maid left the hand sprayer in the on position and aimed outside the tub so that when I turned on the water it sprayed everywhere (seemed suspiciously on purpose). I ordered a turkey club from their crappy Fresh Bites room service program, and for $22 I got a tiny sandwich with gray bacon on a soggy roll that looked like it was made at least 24 hours prior. I hope Marriott doesn’t drag down the Starwood properties the way they have with their own. I come to Chicago all the time on business and only stayed here because it was a 2 min walk to my meeting.

The location was ideal, I could not have asked for a better part of the city. We had a mid floor which was good for us however you will get a better view with a higher view. They have entrances on Rush street and Michigan avenue. The lobby had several security guards for safety. As Marriott Elite members we did not have to pay for internet however their is a fee for non-members. We enjoyed the restaurant and the bar in the lobby. The Starbucks in the lobby was convenient for morning tea and coffee. The rooms were quiet however you could hear sirens outside at times.

309,"Great location- no doubt about that. Wonderful view, especially at sunset, from high floor was spectacular.However, as some others noted earlier, the worst thing about our stay was room temperature control. Thermostat didn’t work, so when we set it at 70 degrees, actual temp went up to 80. We called the front desk, and the technician came the following day and somewhat fixed the issue. But two rooms we reserved, both had the same issue.Checking in took a long time (female rep). She kept repeating same questions. We requested a double room (“guaranteed” at reservation on app), but they didn’t have it. We are family of four with teenagers. So, if King+double combo, I would have liked the connecting room.Cafe was convenient.Bell boys were courteous, friendly, and helpful.Towel quality was sad.",21-Apr-19,Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Chicago_Marriott_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
310,"Where do I begin?! This was a wonderful hotel and my family and I throughly enjoyed our stay! It’s right downtown on the Mag Mile. You’re so close to all the food and shopping your heart desires.We were checked in quickly and easily and given directions to our room. The room was very clean and modern. They only negative I have is the bathroom. The door was one of those sliding “barn” doors that are really in right now. It didn’t lock, which meant not a lot of privacy from our 3 year old while using the restroom LOL.It also made for a muggy room after someone had a shower because there was no exhaust fan either. Because of the style of door, it leaves a gap where steam can escape. Our room got quite warm every time someone showered and it took a while for the temp to be regulated again. It also made the windows be covered in condensation because it was so warm in the room and chilly outside.All the staff I encountered were super friendly, but Sharon the runner took the cake! She found an aggravated me attempting to get a Pepsi out of my third vending machine with no luck because of my damaged card. She asked my room number and within 10 minutes was back with my Pepsi, a cup with ice and a straw! I thanked her and I asked her what time laundry pick up was. My toddler has a special blanket that was in desperate need of cleaning.Unfortunately, the time had already passed for pick up that day. Seeing the urgent need for my little boy to have his blankey, she offered to personally take the blanket down and have it washed and back to me before bed time. I stressed that this blanket was very important to me as well as to him. She called me to let me know when it was going in the dryer and she would have it back soon. I cannot express how grateful I am for the exceptional level of service I received from her! It really truly touched me and she went above and beyond expectations!The hotel is on point with service as well as services. It has a full bar, restaurant, ballrooms, meeting rooms, FedEx services, room service and the list goes on. The bell man got our taxi to the airport for us and loaded our luggage as we were leaving. We will without a doubt stay here again in the future. We were VERY happy with our stay! Thank you so much for making our trip to the Windy City a fantastic one!

312,"I attended a 5 day conference hosted at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnifient Mile and was consistently blown away by the staff’s above and beyond service. At every turn I was met with courtesy and professionalism that exceeded my expectations. I called about an alarm going off in the next room and it was resolved within 10 minutes. I ordered a package delivered and they graciously accepted it at the desk and delivered it to my room. We asked a staff member for L Train directions and she took time to research with us, walked us to the door, gave us her business card for future questions and then offered her favorite ideas for nearby food and attractions. The accommodations were clean and well maintained. There was limited storage in the room but that is minor. A mirror in the main room would also not go amiss, as any woman can attest to when traveling with other women! Beyond these tiny recommendations, this experience was exceptional and I felt like I was treated with the attention and care equal to their highest paying clients.",13-Apr-19,Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Chicago_Marriott_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

The cherry on the top by far was a tech telling us the building has been like this for forty years. Is this company really doing so poorly they can’t fix an issue that hundreds of people complain about at this hotel? Does it take even twenty years to at least offer paying customers a box fan?

314,"Stayed here for a conference. Room was on the 25th floor, great views of downtown areas and the room was recently updated and very comfortable. Room was well maintained by cleaning staff. Conference facilities are pretty good, too, and I thought the food was good. The lobby setup is a little strange with a bar right in the middle as you come in the front door, and the check in area barely noticeable off to the right, but it's not hard to figure out and the service (for both the bar and check-in) are excellent. Tons of shops and restaurants all around. I recommend Eataly a minute walk from the front entrance if you are looking for a quick bite or to stock up your room with some snacks.Note that every hotel in this area will get a lot of siren activity owing to Northwestern University medical center down the street.",7-Apr-19,Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Chicago_Marriott_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

Of course no one came. I cannot imagine we are the only ones in the hotel with this issue. Terrible planning on the hotel's part. Did they really not forsee this? Cost cutting measures are apparent.

317,"As a Marriott Titanium member, I've stayed at most of the Marriott properties in downtown Chicago, however, this was my first time here. As such, I can't help compare the MagMile Marriott to the Gwen, Renaissance, and Hotel Chicago - all of which I have stayed at a number of times. The good: location can't be beat, right on Michigan, close to many things we were in town to do; renovated rooms so they feel clean; check in was friendly; valet parking is less expensive than the others I've mentioned; we had a room right by elevator, but didn't hear any noise from itThe not so great: felt very sterile and impersonal, compared to Hotel Chicago, (which is my favorite), renovations are still going on in the lobby, and while there wasn't any work going on during the weekend, the Pantry seemed to be our only option for breakfast, and the lines were always crazy long, even just for coffee; rooms only have double beds vs queens; no club access for elite members - this would not be such a big deal, if the pantry lines were not always so long: as others have mentioned, on the high floors, the bed nearest the window was very coldOverall it was a good stay, but if not for location, I will likely return to one of my favorites on a future visit.",3-Apr-19,Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87592-Reviews-Chicago_Marriott_Downtown_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

Then you realize that Chicago is a loud city, so the window in your room which is big enough is only single glass, can't keep the sound out and it get cold so fast, so you have to keep the heating on which is so loud too.I can hear everything in the other rooms like the wall id made from paper.

I guess I just didn’t realize the turkey sandwich I ordered was prewrapped & I could have walked down to get it myself...instead, was charged $6 for someone to bring it up to me. However, I have to brag on Marlon from the hotel. I came down with a stomach bug while there & he took great care of me. I called down for an extra blanket & 30 minutes went by & still no blanket. I called the front desk again & they offered me a complimentary beverage. I chose a ginger ale & pretty soon there was a knock at my door. Marlon was there with my ginger ale & he also brought me some crackers. He filled up my ice bucket & then brought me a nice, fluffy blanket.

327,We stayed in a remodeled room 3919 with 2 queen beds. The room was modern in design with a very nice oversized flat screen TV. The beds were comfortable and the room and bath were very clean but not much closet space for 2 people. The room offered a long flat counter space under the TV for luggage bags in case you didn't want to unpack and live out of your suitcase. There is little to no drawer space. This must be the latest trend. The lobby is under construction and mobbed but our check in was speedy ( a welcome relief) .... we were able to have early access to our room. While our room was nice with a great view.... the noise level at 2 and 3 am was obnoxious with guests returning to their room....loud talking and and slamming doors each night of our stay.As previously mentioned in other reviews the hotel is in a great location with easy access to a taxi or uber. The staff overall couldn't have been nicer.The biggest disappointment was the hotel restaurant where we ate breakfast. The prices were very expensive and the food is subpar. I found the buffet strange as everything was made to order instead of walking around and randomly selecting your choices. While my son ordered from the buffet I ordered from the menu and the food was not good and I waited at least 25 minutes for my omelette. This area should be the next renovation.Go elsewhere and have a better breakfast for much less money.I have been a Marriott rewards member for over 30 years.

341,"‼NEGATIVE 5️⃣ FOR CHICAGOI have been the biggest fan of Hilton Garden Inn. HOWEVER, the location at 55 E. 11th St., Chicago, IL 60605 has to be the most unprofessional group I've ever had to encounter. Where shall I start?I arrived to the hotel requesting an early check-in. As a frequent traveler and travel agent, I realize the ability to receive an early check-in may not be accommodated. I was told to have a seat, and when a room was available, I could check-in. I sat next to the front desk for slightly over 2 hours. Yet when a party walks in and asks if they have vacancies and are immediately checked-in, there is an issue.It didn't end there. My reservations, and there were multiple guests that I booked rooms for, were confirmed via a 3rd-party vendor (approved by Hilton). The front desk representative said she could not honor the reservations because we were not charged enough -- the difference of $200+. If that were true, that discrepancy should be directed to your vendor, not me. After 40 minutes of haggling, I finally made it to my room (no longer as an early check-in). As an apology, the desk clerk offered me a 16-oz. bottle of water (that normally sells for $2.50).The next morning, I received a call from the front desk at 7:18 a.m. indicating I owed a balance on the rooms I reserved. First, why are you calling the room at 7:18 a.m.?! I went downstairs to address the ""issue"". The end result: no further monies owed. I would like to say that this was an isolated case. However, after having to wake up earlier than anticipated, I walked to a nearby coffeeshop to start my day. When I returned, and for the next two days, the front desk had more than a dozen occupants at the desk arguing about the hotel's bookkeeping issues.

342,"My friend and I stayed here for LakeShake Festival. Loved the location of the hotel to the event and everything in the area. This hotel has no complimentary breakfast. There are two hotels attached to one building. The other hotel receives the free breakfast. Which, I feel should be switched. The other is a Wyndham extended stay with a full kitchen vs our rooms that only come w a small fridge. So, you would think since they can accommodate themselves with their own cooked breakfast. They would give it to the side that is unable to cook their own breakfast. You can get breakfast if you add it to your stay at a much higher price or your a platinum member. But, weighing the numbers it was much cheaper for us to just go out and buy are own breakfast verses adding it to our stay. Otherwise, the stay was great. Rooms very spacious. Nice outdoor area with several grills next to pool and hot tub.

I like the location because it is still a great place to stay for walking to site seeing locations and yet quieter than top touristy locations. The rooms are fresh and and the view from our room was very good on the 24th floor. The staff is enthusiastic but still learning since it is brand new.

We really enjoyed the sound system and the song selections available. The decor was also very fun. There were snacks/light breakfast items in the basement in the morning.

I called the Celeste Suites myself just to make sure and the really hostile person (I’m guessing owner) said we didn’t have a reservation.

353,"What a night last night. There are scams on airbnb and HomeAway. Last night was a fiasco. Rented the same place for the shoot last night through HomeAway. Everything was fine she remembered me from September and said yes shooting etc was fine again. She sent me the front door code to get into the building and said the unit is open. Got in with the code ok and went up to the unit and the door was locked. I called her and she wouldn't answer and I left a voicemail. An hour goes by and still nothing. The photographers were here from New York and were supposed to leave later last night so we were on a time limit sort of. So all of the other units were unlocked like last time and the owner had no problem with us using all of the units that were open last time if they are unlocked they aren't rented. So we just went into one waiting for her to get back to us it wasn't a big deal the last time. An hour later I get a phone call and voicemail from some guy that said he's just across the street and will be right over to open the unit. Two hours go by and this idiot busted through the door of the unit we were in while I was changing and half naked. He screamed at me wtf are you doing here yada yada. I said who are you he said he was one of the owners. Told us to get out and he's calling the police. And he was shaking, all red in the face and smelled like strong hard liquor. I said I'm not leaving I rented fair and square you were supposed to be here three hours ago. I said then go open the locked unit I was promised he refused. He said no you guys can rent another time. And asked me how much did you rent a unit for $350?? Pffft! Do you know how much a place like this can go for?? Do you know the wallpaper in here is hand painted!??I told him- I DONT CARE! I rented fair and square with Goriana not you!! He wouldn't leave and forced us out of there. One of the photographers noticed something about the tv and recording stuff and when he unplugged it that idiot barged in almost like he was watching everything!So I called HomeAway customer service number and told them this drunk baffoon barged in on me naked, told us to leave and threatened to call the police and now we are out on the street and he ruined our shoot. They said he can't do that and they will get to the bottom of it. They wouldn't answer their calls while I was on hold on the other end. The guy said he noticed the owner just cancelled the reservation which he isn't supposed to do and only refunded the deposit not the amount of the room. HomeAway can't refund the money only the owner. So I don't know what to do besides call American Express and dispute this charge. And now I realize why he cancelled it right away- so now I can't leave a review! Why would the only unit that was rented be locked? What a scam to try and legally kick us out.

I had not received an communication from the owner or property manger so figured someone would be at the property to greet us. No one was there, nor was there any information in the emails I had received from hotels.com with information about the enter the building. I called the number on the email confirmation about 6-7 times and left a voicemail. Finally someone returned my call and proceeded to scream at me about not being able to read emails because the information was sent to me, along with other important information and threatening to make me leave the property. Once we got inside the room I got another phone call saying that the welcome email had never been sent, and that ""computers have a mind of their own"".

356,"Celeste Celebrity Suites offer outstanding accommodation at a reasonable price. The location is amazing for walkers with Oak Beach a few minutes to the east, great restaurants/park two minutes west, the Magnificent Mile a mere 7 minutes south and Old Town 10 minutes north (Second City approx. 20 minute walk). The street is quiet and tree lined. Need a cab, flag one down on N Lake Shore (a few steps away). Using the subway, the Red Line (perfect for Wrigley Field) is a few blocks away. Parking? Not on the street. A parking lot is a few doors down (approx. $40 daily).The accommodation is unique with its celebrity themes and has a certain wow factor (we stayed in the Liz Taylor suite and the Elvis Presley suite). All units have either a kitchenette or a full kitchen. All suites are spacious and well maintained. (Note: If you are in the market for two bedrooms and you have a budget of about $400.00 US/night, the Grace Kelly suite (we did a walk through) is incredible and represents unbeatable value for Chicago). The lower level common area is well furnished and pleasant. The rear courtyard is a perfect oasis to enjoy a quiet pre dinner drink or snack. Please be aware....This is not an on site run bed and breakfast where you are welcomed by a couple, their Golden Lab and the accompanying breakfast repast. Nor is it a mish-mash of Victorian décor and quilts like we have stayed in (and enjoyed) in other cities. This place is elegantly different. It's more of a high end boutique inn with B&B touches. Breakfast is a self served bowl of cereal, toast/jam, a piece of fruit, yogurt and perhaps a hard boiled egg. It gets you started. Going to the neighborhood grocery store (Treasure Island Foods) is not a bad option to augment your stay whether it be for breakfast or any other meal or snack you care to prepare in your suite. Should you need her, the property manager responds quickly to any texted requests and demonstrates professionalism at all times. She's great.All in all we can't imagine staying anywhere else in Chicago. A few tips....the gelato in the park is good tasting and neat for people/high end car watching. Order the two scoop bowl and share (single scoop-$5, two scoops $6!). ...any of the restaurants in the park are easy to recommend....google a self guided walking tour of the Gold Coast neighborhood, great way to spend some time.",2-Sep-17,Celeste Celebrity Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d10723985-Reviews-Celeste_Celebrity_Suites-Chicago_Illinois.html

359,"After securing tickets for a U2 concert in June, we starting looking for a room back in February. Virtually all the hotel rooms in Chicago were booked up, along with all of the B and Bs. Except for this one. Wonder why this was the only one with a room left. If you read some of the other reviews from visitors you can quickly learn the reason. I booked a specific room back in early February, was then sent a confirmation email from Gorianna. A few days later I received another email indicating that room was already booked, even though I was just confirmed a few days earlier. A little odd, and not the best book keeping but we agreed to be moved to another room. Then just days later we received yet another email saying our reservation had been cancelled, they were all booked. WHAT???? I called Gorianna and she said we could have a room. She books on several sites and was clearly very confused and could not keep track of what was happening. My husband and I were feeling a bit concerned about showing up at this business in June, as she might have a room for us or might not. We were able to secure another place to stay that we felt more comfortable with, so I called Gorianna to ask if she could possibly repost the room to see if it could be rebooked. We understood we were past the cancellation window, and clearly indicated in both a voice mail as well as emails that we would not cancel if she would not refund our money. We would still stay there if she could not rebook as we did not want to be out our $175. Gorianna called screaming saying she would not even try ( even though she could easily rebook. And if you note virtually every other B and Bs fine print, even with late notice they are generally happy to push the button on their computer to see if they can rebook. ) We would have been happy to just show up as planned if she did not treat us so rudely In addition to yelling, she was going on about us not bringing in extra people to the room. What?? Who is she even talking to? Did she even know? We are two very tired parents with a toddler and a puppy looking forward to a night in the city, and are usually in bed by 9:30. She was incoherent, couldn't seem to hold on the line of conversation, and very rude. My husband also called her got yelled at, hung up on, and told we were not welcome at her property. This is a business owner on the very bottom of the list, and it is easy to see why. We have had such great experiences with so many B and Bs, and were so surprised with her odd and rude behavior. Kind of thought it was a Saturday Night Skit, it was that bad. As we have a HUGE chain of very odd emails from her, we do have ways we can fight the charge. She cancelled the reservation, we did not. Even if you are desperate, as we were keep trying and find something else. You would be better staying at the bus station than with this very crazy and strange lady. How many more terrible reviews can she possibly get?

They would not cancel because their last cancellation date was on 4/7/17. Excuse me, but that cancellation date was BEFORE I even booked the room. OH, they would have been perfectly happy to cancel my reservation, but I would not get a refund. You know, this is probably not illegal. But it is certainly immoral to have a cancellation date that precedes your booking date. Why didn't they just say ""NO CANCELLATIONS"" on the website.

I called the booking website, and they said my room was booked and guaranteed. When I responded the owners request, I simply stated that I had a guaranteed booking and that the owner needed to contact the booking website directly if there was a problem. The owner proceeded to rudely demand that I cancel, and stated that she would not provide a room to me for the reserved dates. I repeatedly requested that she deal with the booking website and finally had to ask her not to contact me again. She still will not contact the booking website and will not answer their calls either.What a disappointing introduction to what appeared to be a quaint getaway spot. My husband and I stay in the city often and this B & B has lost the opportunity to gain a new, loyal customer and missed out on referrals as well. I guess I'll chalk this up to a terrible lack of self-restraint, rudeness in multiples of ten, and an inability to recognize that customer satisfaction is the name of the game. If you want to stay away from all the touristy hubbub go to Public at State and Goethe or The Willows off Surf Street.

The room was very comfy and the space was satisfactory considering the location of the hotel. The restaurant staff (when it's actually open) are extremely friendly and wonderful to talk to.

371,"Stayed for one night. This hotel is in a great location and is a classic, historic property. It's a block north of the Hancock Tower and half a block off Michigan Avenue. The basic guest room is small, but recently renovated and quite nice. There is plenty of closet space and despite it's roughly 250 sq foot space, didn't feel crowded. It had a desk with comfortable desk chair, TV and bed, leaving out some sort of reading chair/recliner to save space.The room was renovated somewhat recently, with a nice bathroom featuring a walk-in shower with rainshower head and a shower wand. The one real negative was that the bath amenities included only one bar of soap and no shower gel.One thing I did find funny was that in the honor bar, a bottle of Fiji water cost as much as a bottle of beer.Service interactions were typical of a mid-tier property. Nothing bad, but not like you would encounter in a 5-6 star property.

373,"An old hotel with lots of charm and history but in minor need of a lIck of paint and a new carpet or two. The common areas are very well done and good places to hang out but the rooms are just a bit below the standards you would expect of a hotel in this range. The large beds and smart TVs are great but the flooring and the corridors on room level just need a bit of a refurb. However, the bathrooms are good, rooms are clean and the hotel has good service. Decent value and a brilliant location for downtown Chicago.

I went up to my room and discovered that, while there was a level shower in my bathroom, it was not a roll in shower, and did not have grab bars. I called the front desk, and they worked to find me another room. I went to check that out...bathtub. Definitely not accessible. I went down to the front desk to ask what could be done. In the end the best they could promise me was that they 'might' have a room with an accessible bathroom for my second night. In the end they refunded me for my entire stay, but the experience was frustrating.

380,We arrived the Knickerbocker after a larger event had wrapped up causing some issues in the street in front. Let's be honest - this is Chicago - if you think you're going to park easily I have some beachfront property in Arizona that might interest you.Kaylin at the front desk was a true professional. Had us checked in with great recommendations and the room was top shelf.

Flash forward 10 days (5/3/19 at 1:25PM) and I have to call the hotel again because the charge was not credited back to me. The person who took my call was extremely unhelpful and seemed like they could care less about my issue. I was told he could not find my name in their system even though we stayed less than a month ago. I then asked him what I should do because there was clearly a charge from the Millennium Knickerbocker on my statement regardless of whether they could find it in their system or not. His response?

383,"Recently I've become a ""GROUPIE"" aka addicted to GROUPONS. During the Holiday Season I came across a coupon for High Tea at the Knickerbocker Hotel. High tea is on my bucket list but, it is usually very $$$. When I came across a Groupon for High Tea at the Knickebocker, I purchased the voucher: $60 tea for 2, cost $32.The Hotel is vintage charming and the Lobby is very small. The High Tea is held at the Bar and a small Library alcove which is basically the Lobby. Everyone coming in and out of the Hotel, will see you sipping and munching. I would've preferred a more private setting.The photo which is on Groupon of the High Tea is NOT what we received. We got 2 mini egg salad toast points with a high onion content (yuk), 2 mini tomato slices with mozzarella cheese and a sprig of basil, 2 mini tuna salad points. Basically, the cheapest food available.The scones in the photo look large and delicious, ours were small and hard. A total of 6 desserts were provided: 2 mini cupcakes, 2 mini tarts & 2 macaroons. The desserts and tea were very good. The mini sandwiches, blah and boring.Been there, done that.",20-Apr-19,Millennium Knickerbocker Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87648-Reviews-Millennium_Knickerbocker_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

The small enclosed shower stall required me to stand under it while selecting the temperature - not good when the water runs cold for what seemed like a long while. The water pressure was poor in the shower and the basin plug did not hold water. The carpet in my room looked as though it had seen better days and the paint on the woodwork was chipped in many places.

We arrived before posted check-in time but our room was ready and the front desk person was so friendly. We told her we were hungry and she gave us the scoop on the options within the hotel. We checked in and then needed to grab a quick lunch before our spa treatments at Elizabeth Arden, which is just one door down. We went to the hotel restaurant. Frankly, I usually avoid hotel restaurants because I find them to be significantly overpriced and the food is usually average. But, we were in a hurry and it was cold and we didn't feel like walking to find food. We had amazing service in the restaurant. There was only one other pair dining at that time (a late lunch), but still, our waiter and water guy were great. We ordered a club sandwich to split and they graciously put it on two plates for us, each with our own set of fries (without us asking). Presentation was great, food was great. Exactly what we needed.Our next service experience was just before bar closing time when we encountered a super friendly and down-to-earth hotel bartender. I believe he said he'd been with the hotel 20 years!! He was great and we enjoyed some laughs at the bar before turning in for the night.Overall we had a very pleasant stay.

At the desk the first young lady Diana said we had a tub I have a 2 year old I needed the tub when we returned to a rude guy at front desk he did not give us tub and told us it would be a extra charge this was NEVER advised!!!

The other, Bruce, was very accommodating with helping us check in and out and he really helped me put the finishing touches on the mystery party.

424,"Lang House, which is owned and run by Bruce & Wade is the most beautiful and charming B&B I've known. Speaking as a hotel owner as well as a world class traveler, I have seen and stayed at too many to count hotels or B&B's. However, Lang House surpasses all expectations! First of all the cleanliness, the decor, the comfort - but most of all the feeling of being ""at home"" away from home. Not only can I not praise it enough, but having experienced an extended stay gave me a new perception of what true hospitality looks like. The kitchen is open 24 hours a day - snacks and drinks are always available, as is the laundry room. The beds are true heaven! The hosts respect privacy yet are always available when needed. Public transportation is truly no more than a 1 minute walk (bus) or 5 minutes (red line). I'm still processing having been ""blown away"" by Lang House and its owners.

432,"No B & B is a winner without great hosts, and The Lang House has two winners with Wayde and Boyd, who are a great combination of professional, helpful and friendly. The Lang House has wonderful original architectural features, such as original hand painted murals in the parlor and sun room, and a great kitchen & breakfast set up in a well planned/laid out, self-serve type kitchen. The guest rooms are very comfortable with every need fulfilled, complete with a mini fridge for those restaurant left-overs, an unusual touch in a B & B. Breakfast is one of the main reason's we enjoy B & B travel, and due to my allergies, they kindly made a special egg dish without cheese for me, which was delicious. Our room had a transitional decor that was timeless, elegant and serene, with a comfortable, upholstered loveseat, bedside tables with lamps for reading, and included a desk, where I could set up my makeup mirror, or sit to use a laptop. The room had large windows which let us enjoy their neighboring property, The Emil Bach House, a Frank Lloyd Wright Designed Home, to the south, and their entrance garden, filled with tulips and other spring blooms, facing the street on the west side. Even though Sheridan Road is busy during the day, once the shades are pulled down and the heavy, designer drapes are drawn, at night the room becomes tranquil and peaceful for a good night's sleep. The marble and subway tile bathroom was wonderful and had a delightful shower. They supplied fluffy, spa robes, and also had an iron and ironing board in the closet, which came in handy for us. The Inn has wonderful common spaces, and we hung out for a while in the basement level family room, where we took in a DVD movie, but they have subscription service to stream movies as well. The home also has some great outdoor hangout/dining spaces, along with a fully equipped Sauna and Spa Space, and they are only a stone's throw from Lake Michigan. Situated between Northwestern and Loyolla University, on Sheridan Road, makes the Inn ideal, especially if you are in town for a graduation, as we were. As a Designer, I appreciate when no harm has been done to the original Architecture of the Home and the interior design embraces the home, rather than being in stark contrast, and they have pulled this balance off with perfection. And I need to add, that the entire home is also spotlessly clean and uncluttered. The only downside we could find, was that they could use some new bed pillows, as theirs were aging, and there was no communal dining for breakfast, which we really enjoy for getting to know the Innkeepers and other guests, but we realize that some people don't. We hope to return to the Lang House again, as Wade and Boyd have made it better than any hotel could ever be, with the at-home feeling, value, comfort and service,",16-May-18,Lang House Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1995621-Reviews-Lang_House_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

I enjoyed reading in the stunning common areas, talking with who I chose to talk to but not feeling overwhelmed. The room and bathroom were perfect. I even did a little laundry, as this was part of a longer trip. The neighborhood is a block from the lake and has a large park, perfect for a walk. Not many stores, which was odd. Couple of blocks to the train into the city, which takes 40mins. but you'll get a seat because it's the start of the line. I enjoyed the B&B more than downtown. There's a good coffee shop, Charmers, right by the train, too.

444,"We chose a B&B for the first time primarily out of necessity. We usually stay at big hotels and when booking I wasn't sure why it was hard to find a hotel in such a big town. Later I learned that a lot of events were going on during that weekend Lalapolooza, cubs in town, whitesox in town etc. This is a great property away from the hustle and bustle of the big city area. Yet it's close enough to jump on the train and get there in 30 min. It's a real bargain to take the train it was confusing at first because I have never really used public transportation. Seven day pass $35 ride it all you want. It stops at Addison so you can get off right at Wrigley we went to several games this was nice! You can get off at grand right by the Magnificent Mile! We saved thousands on uber, lyft, and cabs using this pass. It's clean and safe a lot of police patrol the big stops. The hotel was very nice and the owners were very polite and accommodating. I sweat a lot at night and it was understandable they couldn't turn the A/C down to low as it might upset the other guests. They brought two fans to my room which helped to keep the room cool and allow me to sleep comfortably. The breakfast is continental style muffins, pastries, cereal, etc. They would have one warm dish usually kolaches or quiche. They had snacks cheese sticks etc that you could get during the day or at night. They had sodas and plenty of bottle water.

In addition, they also provide bicycles/helmets for guests; which we took advantage of as we cycled along Lake Michigan, up to Northwestern University.

I was truly in awe of the woodwork and just the detail of the craftsmanship as well as its location next the Emil Bach house by Frank Lloyd Wright. Entering is not easy if you are parking in the garage. This is not for anyone with mobility issues as I have MS and there are multiple staircases and a decent trek from the parking garage behind the house to our room. Granted it is a bed and breakfast, not a hotel, but I did expect more help with our luggage and to have someone helpful being in the house to answer questions and be present during breakfast, etc. Instead we saw a person at check in that was barely able to help with my suitcase and my daughter was just on her own, and then I think one of the individuals that help manage flit thru quickly to drop a quiche off in the kitchen the next morning. Not the warm, conversational atmosphere I was hoping for during our first of many endeavors in the Chicago area. The room and attached bathroom were just fine, but for the price, not somewhere we would stay again. The sterile management and lack of any personal attention made us decide the Hampton Inn down the street is way more welcoming and 1/3 the price!

463,"I am a wedding and event planner, and must let you know that The Lang House was beyond perfect for my couples lovely wedding this past weekend. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. The Bed and Breakfast is quaint and inviting. It is just darling and from an event standpoint the ease of which my team and catering could work was made possible by Bruce and Wade! They were extremely accommodating and always responded to any need we had logistically. If you are a lover of architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright or just a lover, you should check out this lake front property with all the amenities to have a beautiful weekend event.I truly hope to plan many more events at this property, and maybe even steal a weekend away here myself.Kerrie Gallagher",29-Aug-16,Lang House Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1995621-Reviews-Lang_House_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html
464,"Wadye and Bruce are outstanding inn keepers! This home is not only beautifully decorated and meticulously clean but provided us with a pleasant escape in the big city. The outdoor patio allowed us a space to chat and catch up while enjoying the beautiful surroundings. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea and snacks for anytime enjoyment. I would recommend paying the extra fee in order to park in the garage; so much easier than the hassle of parking on the street.

465,First the positives. The house is beautiful and extremely well maintained. Wayde and Bruce are excellent hosts. The location could not be better close to the Jarvis rail station.The kitchen is well stocked and it is nice to be able to grab snacks and refreshment during the day. The Emil Bach House next door is a must visit. Disappointments were the lack of regular maid service. Although the brochure says no one enters room without permission this is a departure from most B&B's. If you want maid service you should request it in advance. Breakfast was good but not great. There are no controls for temperature in bedroom which during hot weather is a tad uncomfortable. Downstairs was much cooler than upAll in all a nice place to stay for a few days but probably not longer than that. Could easily be a 5 Star Inn with not much extra effort. Still a good place to stay which we recommend,6-Aug-16,Lang House Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1995621-Reviews-Lang_House_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

We had fun walking the streets and the breakfast was a true treat. The host were helpful with tips getting around the city. I think we wore them out with all our questions, but we only had one full day to explore and we wanted to see as much as we could.

467,"The Lange House is a tastefully preserved slice of Northern Chicago in a serene neighborhood. Less than two blocks from the L-train, and even closer to a public beach right alongside the lake, it's location was ideal. We arrived from O'Hare and easily navigated the trains to arrive at the house, where we were met with delectable snacks and an impeccably furnished home. The house's two patios overlook the Frank Lloyd Wright designed home next door and offer an impeccable view of the grounds as well as the home. The Lange Home itself was stupendous. Bruce and Wayne really did everything they could to ensure that we felt at home, and what a home it is. I would say that if you are looking to experience what life was like in a turn-of-the-century mansion, I would highly suggest the Lange House. If we ever find ourselves in Chicago again, we will most certainly stay at the Lange House.",5-Jul-16,Lang House Chicago,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1995621-Reviews-Lang_House_Chicago-Chicago_Illinois.html

There are many cozy places in the several common areas to relax, read, or talk. They even have two outdoor patios and a front porch, with rockers, to enjoy. The location is a quiet neighborhood that is very safe and clean, with several beach parks a block away. An excellent wine shop, where we tasted some great wines, is less than two blocks away. It is next to the ""L"" station, with easy transportation anywhere you want to go. The ride downtown and back was enjoyable, and a great way to view other Chicago neighborhoods, including Wrigley Field. Most of all, the owners, Bruce and Wayde, were very welcoming and helpful with great suggestions for restaurants and things to do.

471,"Booked their studio room (on 31st floor) which comprised of a main area split between a small kitchen (warning to Brits no kettle only coffee maker), generous double bed and a small sofa seating/TV area. In addition there was a large walk-in wardrobe, discreet louvered cupboard housing a washing machine and a large bathroom.Please remember that this was Neocon week and with each & every major hotel fully booked we took a gamble on this place - AND THE GAMBLE PAID OFF.Whilst it's not equal to a Hilton or Marriott 4 or 5* it was clean, had everything that we needed, GREAT location and every staff member that we interacted with was polite, helpful and did their upmost to meet our needs.So in summary if you need to stay in/around the Merchandise Mart and you don't mind fending for yourself when it comes to breakfast, zero room service and alike then this is a wise and cost effective choice.Would I stay at the Oakwood at 200 Squared again - ""Yes"".

They never got back. e.g. I emailed them to warn them their bathtub is too slippery and dangerous (I bruised up my knee despite being careful, see picture below) and I never heard back. - the NOISE. e.g. You can hear the train every 30-40 seconds. I’m from the city and used to noise but it was too much. e.g. additionally, you could hear everything going on in the hallways as well. Soundproofing was clearly nonexistent when building the place. Overall, I came here despite the reviews about the noise because I got a discount. I won’t come back If you just need a place downtown to stay for a single night, go for it. Otherwise, don’t.

474,"First off, I was on the 14th floor above N Wells St and it sounded like the El Train was coming right through my room. It was so loud I turned the TV captions on because I couldn't hear anything. It was really hard to sleep. I tried to call and switch rooms, but the office wasn't open until nine the next morning. By that time I got busy at the office and forgot to call. So I never switched. I ran into a guy on the elevator and he said he was on the 38th floor and it was still really loud. I asked one of the workers downstair and she said, ""You're supposed to ask for a high floor on the other side of the building."" Good to know. Judging by the photos when I made my reservation, I was expecting something incredibly stylish and beautiful. What I got was a long ways from that. But it was pretty large and the bed was comfortable. The TV was small and a long ways away from the bed, so not only was it not a great viewing experience from there, but it was also hard to make the remote work. I know I'm being picky, but those things can really be a pain. Also no premium channels if that's what you're looking for. The price was great, so I'd probably give it another shot, as long as I could look at the room first, but I don't think that's an option with their current setup.",12-Oct-18,Oakwood at 200 Squared,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d10301440-Reviews-Oakwood_at_200_Squared-Chicago_Illinois.html

It’s not as nice as staying in a hotel. The bed was super uncomfortable, very firm. It was impossible to sleep on. Small televisions without HD. I would expect the apartment amenities to be a little nicer since most are staying long term. This wouldn’t be my first choice if I was vacationing in Chicago. But if you had a family, it might be ideal. You can hear the train, it basically surrounds the building. So there are many pros and cons.

477,"Me and my wife spent a week in this suite. We were very satisfied. The building is in loop, very near to the sights, you can reach everything on foot or by public transport. It is worth to buy a Ventra card and fill it up with a pass. There are some smaller food- shops, but if you want to make a bigger shopping the nearest supermarket is the Jewel Osco at the Grand Station of the red line. Our studio was on 40th floor with a marvellous view. The studio itself is spacious with big bathroom and big garderobe. The kitchen is big too and well equipped. Only one cons is that on the right side of the bed there is any furniture to put your things on. There are a lot of plugins, if you are from Europe bring switcher with you. The bed is very comfy. There was nor cleaning,nor changing of towels! This is not a Hotel, so we understood it. You can clean yourself thr room there is enough equipment for it. Thete is a washmachine too. There is small pool, a nice roofterrace with sunbeds and other furnitures and a good hot tube. If you need pool towel, bring with you, because they don't offer it for you. You can ask extra towels for a charge. We asked too, and it came only 2 days later... we didn' t use it because of the weather went wrong.There is business center equipped with 3 computers and a printer... neither worked, as on the ladt day I wanted to use it for the online check in at airline. Fortunately a nice lady from the office helped me, and I could use her computer. Thank you very much for her help.

478,"I was in Chicago for three weeks and wanted to find accommodations that offered a bit more space and a bit more privacy than hotels typically provide. I had stayed in Oakwood properties in Asia and was familiar with the brand, operation, and likely experience. I had a one bedroom flat (kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom) with all the facilities necessary to person staying in a flat -- range, oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer, dishes, glasses, and silverware. The flat had plenty of room for one or two people.The Oakwood does not provide daily housekeeping -- you need to pay US$100 per day for daily housekeeping. However, if you want more of a flat experience, you do not want daily housekeeping -- you make your own bed, change your own towels (towels and linens are provided in the closet), use the dishwasher to do your dishes, and the clothes washer and dryer to handle your laundry. Once every couple of weeks, Oakwood does send cleaning staff to tidy up, vacuum, and change the bedding and towels. Perfect.As this is a ""flat experience,"" you only get one small bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo and conditioner -- bring your own, or organise a necessities shopping trip shortly after arrival. Similarly, you are given enough coffee for one pot and enough tea for a couple of cups. Again, buy what you need.I found the Oakwood staff to be friendly, helpful, and responsive. Complementary coffee was available in the lobby, and it was very nice.So, why did I rate the Oakwood ""average""?1. While my flat was clean -- sinks, toilet, bedding, kitchen, etc., it seemed like the room had not been dusted for quite some time. Perhaps this was the Chicago air (doubtful), or that the heater/air conditioner filters needed a good cleaning (possible), or that the cleaning staff just did not dust the place (likely).2. I had read the TripAdvisor reviews on Oakwood prior to my arrival, and was very fortunate that I had. The Oakwood has two lines of Chicago's elevated train system right outside the building. These trains make a LOT of noise and they run all night. If you are on a high floor and keep the windows shut, the noise is acceptable.3. A huge problem that I had with the Oakwood was that the building has a very old heating and air conditioning system. Here is the problem -- it is binary: either the heating is on or the air conditioning is on. This affects every flat in the building. I think the air conditioning system is turned on at the beginning of May (not sure when it is turned off). If you have warm weather (like we did in April), you get no cool air in your flat! The only thing you can do is to open the window (but then you must listen to very loud trains outdoors). This binary heating/cooling system is probably okay during Chicago's arctic winters and sweltering summers, but during the transition months, expect to suffer. I complained several times, but was always given the same explanation: the building's cooling system has not been switched on yet.4. The decor of the flat was okay, but it definitely had an aged or faded look. The carpeting was sort of a dull grey; the kitchen was not bright and shiny, but dark and dim; the bathroom old -- an old tub with an old shower, and the caulking falling out. Maintenance needed.Overall, okay, but a far cry from the Oakwood experience in Asia.",13-May-18,Oakwood at 200 Squared,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d10301440-Reviews-Oakwood_at_200_Squared-Chicago_Illinois.html

487,"Having stayed at Oakwood 200 for 4 nights, it was different to stay in a apartment as opposed to a hotel bedroom. The studio apartment was well appointed the large walk-in closet was very welcome as there is normally not enough storage in a hotel bedroom. The washing machine and tumble dryer meant going home with a suitcase full of clean clothes - a nice novelty. The kitchen had everything you needed including a full size fridge, saucepans, cutlery, plates and wine glasses coffee maker etc. The apartments floor-to-ceiling windows really had great views over the skyline of Chicago. You do hear a lot of feedback on these forums about the train noise, we could hear the El train but we did not find it too invasive (although we were up on the 31st floor). The swimming pool & sauna we had to ourselves! It seemed under utilised by others , another bonus. The reception staff really were friendly and genuine in their customer service approach. Near this particular location there was not many restaurants open at weekends or evenings as it was mainly office workers that were being catered too, but it really is not a problem, you just have to walk a few blocks and there are several eating establishments readily available. The train station literally is a block away so very very convenient -$3 for a train ride made good value for money. I would recommend staying here.

492,"This is the nicest apt building I have ever stayed in during my 10 years of business travel. I spend 1/3 of my entire year travelling and staying in the gamut of international hotel rentals, temporary apartment rentals and AIR B&B rentals. This building, from its location, to staff and luxurious accommodations, is definitely my favorite thus far. I lucked out in finding a building of this quality on a third -party travel website. Had i not seen it offered there, I would have never believed these units were available for short term rental at such affordable prices. Staff-Leasing agents like Gil and Laura, go WAY out of their way to accommodate you and make your stay a perfect one. Because they were sold out at the building I had originally booked, they upgraded me into a bigger newer unit at this 210 N Wells building and provided me with a 25.00 gift card for my troubles. Had I asked reasonably for something else, I am sure they would have obliged me. Front desk agents like Paul and Tawanna always greeted me by name, assisted me with luggage and generally ""looked out"". They treated me more like a long term VIP resident than a temporary renter. Apartment-Apartment on the 31st floor had nicest views of ANY building i had ever stayed in. I felt like I was ""On Top of the World"". I loved the upgraded appliances and the washer-dryer combo in my unit. I also LOVED the fluffy and soft blankets I found in the closet. Amenities-You have to see to believe the outstanding amenities offered here. Fire pit with built in commercial grills also with that amazing ""On top of the World"" view, a big dog run, indoor swimming pool and a luxurious screening and party room. Location- Located within a block of convenience stores, tons of restaurants, nail salons and spas, a UPS store and immediate access to public transportation. The only down-side was that with such immediate access to the train , it did get really noisy when walking around outside or even just outside the doors. If I lived in Chicago, I wouldn't hesitate to immediately rent out one of these beautiful units. The views and amenities alone are enough to blow you and all your friends who visit away. However, what is really special about this building is truly their staff and their amazing caring and concerned attitudes toward all residents. Their attitudes are five star and as a result, when staying here (even temporarily), you cant help but feel you are in a ""home"" (or at least,) part of a community that cares. I would not hesitate to recommend this building to everyone and anyone I know travelling or living in Chicago. Because of my AMAZING experience with this building, I will likely look for available Oakwood apartment options when travelling in the future.",27-Oct-16,Oakwood at 200 Squared,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d10301440-Reviews-Oakwood_at_200_Squared-Chicago_Illinois.html

494,"The Oakwood apartments are housing for many corporate trainees and temporary employees. They are also home for some of the visiting out-of-town performers at theatres in the Chicago Loop, of which I was recently one. Such beautiful, well- appointed apartments and fabulous amenities! Floor-to-ceiling windows made for splendid views and lots of sunshine. I swam a few times a week in the lap pool while others worked out in the gym. The party suite had a screening room, pool table & outdoor fire pit. The business center was great for printing documents (at least while I was there). The dog run was a unique opportunity for guests to bring pets. The staff was truly delightful! As for location, I was 3 blocks from my theatre (and a few more blocks from shopping, eateries, Millenium Park, and Chicago Institute of Art). Only one block to the river, across which were restaurants, bars, grocery stores and much more.

503,"We chose this hotel in June 2019 because of its great location and option for river views, and both of those agenda items were happily met. River front views are wonderful, and rooms are spacious and comfortable. I gave the hotel 4 stars despite our issues because it was clean, staff was friendly and helpful in general, and the upgraded room mostly compensated for our uncomfortable first night. Unfortunately, the AC in our floor 30 room was not working and replacing the filter did not improve performance. Front desk wanted to move us to an identical room on a lower floor without the river view for the same price, which is unacceptable since I paid more for that view. Ultimately, we stayed in the hot room with a $50 discount for one night and were moved to a nicer room the following day. I wish I hadn't been forced to push back in order to get what I paid for. No AC in the summer is just not ok. Also, as most others have noted, only half of the elevators are in working condition. I can't tell you how many times we stopped on floors below 22 and couldn't allow any more persons on the elevator. Huge inconvenience and frustration, especially to those who are challenged physically. If you can't physically handle walking down 20 flights of stairs in the summer, make sure you ask for an upper room! As I am quite sure every single person who stayed above floor 5 had elevator issues, I feel like the hotel should have offered an apology and some sort of peace offering (free drink at the bar, maybe? This would surely have led to a profit as well).",11-Jul-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html
504,Great location as most attractions were within walking distance or short cab ride. Skip the restaurant as it is average and very expensive. Get the riverview room its worth the extra money. Room was nice except no microwave and the ice machines are on even number floors only. Elevators at check out time was a nightmare but they were working on them.

505,"Senior Citizens/Care providers beware of the unfriendly treatment of seniors with Alzheimer’s disease. My parents were scheduled to attend the sales tour of Wyndham Grand Collection however on that morning my father who suffers from Alzheimer’s wasn’t feeling his self on that day. My mother went & I stayed back to care for my father. She was unable to attend the presentation without him. I had to get him dress & when we got to the presentation they said he was too late to attend. The manager on site would not accommodate our request to attend the sales tour. We were rescheduled to another day. If you have aging parents this may not be an option for the caregiver to consider for them to attend due to illness. I couldn’t believe they were not accommodating. They did not add that thoughtful touch, instead they only added to upsetting my parents.

506,"ProsGreat viewsLess than $200 a night per roomVery CleanConsElevator is barely worth takingNo Free BreakfastParking is almost as expensive as the roomMy wife and I were in Chicago for the 4th of July. We decided to spend a little more and stay in the heart of downtown. The Wyndham had great ratings, amazing views and good prices so we booked there. I skipped the parking and opted to park two blocks away. Instead of $60 a night I paid $50 for 2.5 days. Check in was easy. The room was beautiful and had great views of the river. The property sits on a bend in the Chicago River so you get this great view down a straight stretch. There is a restaurant downstairs but there is no free breakfast. For the amount of money I saved on the room I had to spend it on food, so keep this in mind. But the views made up for it I promise (get a River View). The only bad thing, and it is HORRIBLE are the down elevators. There are only two, and the first morning we waited 18 minutes before giving up and walking. The second day at 12 minutes I pressed the up arrow and had to ride to the top floor before picking up half a dozen people on the way down. It was the only way to get in a car.

Finally, they sent engineers (3 different ones) who couldn't fix it. They blew out the coils bringing more bad stuff into the air. The hotel shouldn't be allowed to book this room.

With so many terrific options on the riverfront, we would never choose this location again.Pros: A centrally located property with polite staff, particularly housekeeping.Cons: The elevator situation is abysmal. 10+ minute wait was standard to get on a slow, overcrowded elevator. Only 2 of the 4 appeared to be working the weekend we were there. Long lines for check-in and check-out. We stayed in Room 3509. The room was clean but showed significant signs of wear: drywall tape had peeled and fallen in the bathroom. Closet door fixtures were detached. The bathtub had a discolored patch and visible rust on its exterior. The bathtub did not drain properly. The room was adjacent to a service room / elevator that produced a loud squeaking sound day and night, waking us up periodically.

515,"The hotel is located near the Chicago River, as the name implies, but I am not sure if there is anything ""Grand"" about the hotel. The hotel isn't particularly bad, just not very good. The rooms in this hotel are large, which is nice. The rooms could use an update. The thermostat on the wall lets you adjust the air warmer or colder and on or off, but doesn't let you set a specific temperature, so the air is either on all night or it isn't. There are three way lamps in the room, which should allow the user to have softer or brighter light, they have florescent lights installed in them, so they just turn on and off. The hotel is currently undergoing an elevator renovation and the wait times horrible, 5 minutes plus at times. The hotel is 39 stories, so it isn't practical to take the stairs if you are on a higher floor. I didn't find the hotel staff, for the most part to be particularly friendly. The hotel does have great views of the city and the river. The rooms were fairly sound proof, but the doors to each rooms slam shut, so if your neighbors are coming and going from their room early in the morning, the noise will wake you up.",29-Jun-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html

I paid $67 per night for the hotel valet to park my car, words cannot describe my displeasure. The valet staff were fine, just the price struck me as an issue. I did take note of 2 staff who were less than professional but I didn’t have time to dwell on discourteous doormen and desk receptionists. The remainder of the staff were as expected, polite professionals with quick smiles and helpful attitudes. The hotel has a problem with elevator capacity, too many guests for so little elevator room. This became a notable problem during high traffic times, it was particularly pronounced just before a wedding in the hotel on Saturday. My wife believes the view of the river from our room made the price tag reasonable, I would catch her standing there staring out many times. I confess, it was spectacular. The room was great in my eyes, no complaints. They should consider installing USB ports for recharging electronics. Guests should also be aware of thin walls.

They’ll entice you with gift cards or Wyndham points. No, no, NO! Then, the phone rang at 7:35 the next morning. I didn’t answer because I know from experience that they will still try to get you to a meeting. Thankfully, that was the last of that.The whole room is modern and clean.

533,We're staying in the hotel side of the Wyndham Grand as opposed to the resort side. I'm not sure what the difference is but perhaps it's just putting us on a lower floor.

The noise level from outside is expected but they really need to do something about inside noise. We draw the curtains at night which blocks out all the light except for the 33 holes I counted in just the left side of the curtain alone. We went to take the elevator down and they're doing a complete redo of the four elevators one of the time so at best they have three working.

536,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand on May 16th, 2019. We flew in late and took the Blue Line to Washington and walked the 4 blocks to the hotel. The hotel is clean and great location! We got up the next morning and did a little sightseeing before we had to head to my daughter's basketball tournament in Wisconsin. I was able to check out and they kept my luggage. Great hotel! Would definitely stay here again when I come to Chicago. The river view from your room is wonderful!

537,The hotel restaurant is not that great. They over charged me and Jeff in Accounting is taking his time to correct the issue. The food in the restaurant is Mediocre at best and they don't have room service in the evening. You have to go pick up your food however they charge you as if it was room service. The hotel elevators are not working properly and the Hallways are dingy and has somewhat of a mildew feel. It's an old hotel and needs to be renovated in my opinion. ,21-May-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html

Excellent view of the chicago river spoiled only by trump’s oversized letters. We arrived late and had to eat at the hotel restaurant and that was another pleasant surprise. Juice angus beef burger at a reasonable price. Walking distance without being athletic or sweating your hair to several locations. Only downside were the elevators during peak hours but they are being renovated so that is temporary. We will return.,13-May-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html
542,"The hotel gave me mixed feelings. It is situated in front (but not directly in front, there is a road between them) of the river and it is probably an older building which has been re innovated. The building shows its age but the work done there leaves a good overall impression. The room was very big and spacey with two big beds and very clean with some but not all amenities. And now lets start with the problems. I stayed in Wyndham Grand in several countries and I must say that this cannot reach their level. First of all the room didnt have any bath robe or slippers so you must bath with a relatively small towel. The blanket is short and so if a person taller than 1.80 wants to sleep then his feet will be more probable out of the blanket. The is no room service!!!!!!! in the hotel. If you need food you can order it and then go down to the restaurant and pick it up. The restaurant is understaffed so we had to call more than 3 times and wait 10 minutes each time in order to order our food from the room. And of course the menu is limited. But the major problem with the restaurant is the breakfast: There is not buffet, the menu is mainly American breakfast and very very limited, so if you want continental you cannot have it, and extremely expensive. We paid for a breakfast of two (without any exaggerations) more than 60 dollars more than we paid for a lunch or dinner!!) The staff is friendly and helpful. There was a problem with the elevators but there is a sign that they are under construction. Also the ringing from the elevator reaching the floor is far to loud (it is annoying when you want to sleep). Overall the hotel is not reaching the status of a Wyndham Grand and I wouldnt visit it again",12-May-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html

545,"My room was very spacious with a view overlooking the Chicago river. I think even a frequent traveler of Chicago can enjoy taking a minute to look out over the city from the room. I also enjoyed the huge rain shower in the bathroom, that was an unexpected luxury that was nice to enjoy. I would recommend bringing some ear plugs if you're a light sleeper as the hotel is in the heart of the city so it can get loud at times (honking, sirens, etc). The elevators can also be noisy if your room is nearby on either side. I had a good experience with the staff, from valet drivers to front desk and attached restaurant. Everyone was polite and efficient and made the stay really easy. The location is great for walking to nearby restaurants and entertainment as well. Overall a really nice hotel experience! The only downside was that on a higher floor, the elevators can take a long time to arrive at peak hours. I was on the 14th floor and actually took stairs down twice because I waited longer than 5 minutes in the hallway to catch an elevator.",8-May-19,Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87603-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Chicago_Riverfront-Chicago_Illinois.html

Some things, however, make you wonder: (1) The AC was set to 60 degrees when I arrived never got particularly cool; (2) the blackout curtains didn’t do the job, because they are old and worn and had may visible holes (pictured); I waited >10 minutes for an elevator more than once and 12 floors is just too far to walk.

555,My fiance and I made a last minute trip to Chicago and were pleased to find this hotel with my Wyndham Rewards account. The rates for a weekend were very affordable for the location. The only downside is the expensive parking. It was half the price of the room. The wait to get checked in was a little long. We were checking in on a Friday and there was only 1 person working the counter. Once we got to the room it was beautiful with a great view. They left a nice treat for us on the desk for our Anniversary that made the occasion more special. The room was huge and very clean. Be sure to upgrade and do the river view.

We wanted to book multiple excursions, but could only catch her once to book Willis Tower Skydeck. It was discounted though. Her restaurant recommendations were outdated and not good. The room was okay. Bed was comfy, and the shower was sufficiently big enough. The water felt like it didnt get all the way hot though. Other than that it was a quality stay.

560,"I traveled to Chicago with a colleague for a business trip and stayed for 4 nights.The lobby of the hotel is definitely cool - definitely has a great ambience and vibe. The hotel was built in the 1920's, so it definitely has great architecture.The hotel bar was totally popular and crowded into the early hours of the morning and the breakfast was pretty good! The gym was also great! Although the mood/ambience was cool, I would not stay here again. We requested early check in, which was not granted - normally not a big deal, but my colleague that booked the rooms is a very high Marriott Rewards member. They kept our bags while we had to leave to go do work things, but didn't give us a ticket or anything as a receipt even though we requested one and assured us our bags would be fine. When we arrived back to the hotel, our bags were nowhere to be seen and no one knew what happened to them (they ended up being in our rooms, but it was scary that no one knew where they were). The biggest issue I had at this hotel was the cleanliness of the hotel. The cool vibe/decor of the whole place masks the fact. I had to change rooms upon arrival because my bed had huge, yellow stains all over the mattress - I am someone who does do a bed check when I arrive at a hotel because I'm a bit of germaphobe, but OMG that was my worst nightmare. That was absolutely totally unacceptable for a W hotel. They have these weird semi-mattress covers under the sheets that bunch up when you sleep and I feel like it probably made people really sweaty over the years and it soiled the mattress pretty badly. I will say thank goodness for Irene because she was absolutely amazing and moved me to a nice, clean, and bigger room; however, the fact that that was even an issue in the first place was totally unacceptable. Irene sent a little treat later that night to apologize, which was a sweet gesture.I also met a friendly lady staying on my floor who said she had to call security because there was a drunk, naked man banging on her door at 1:30am. Also, the AC in the room I was switched into didn't work and I had to get someone to come upstairs to fix it while I was there. Honestly if you're thinking about staying at this hotel, I would say look elsewhere. My colleague is very Marriott brand loyal and won in the battle of what hotel to stay in, but next time I will be absolutely staying at the Hilton Palmer House or Hilton Chicago.",24-Jun-19,W Chicago - City Center,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d220240-Reviews-W_Chicago_City_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html

CIBC theater. Art Institute of Chicago. All walks were less than 10 mins. Google map was a great help. All that was great and I really enjoyed my visit. Good thing Walgreens and CVS were nearly everywhere for my allergies did not like whatever type of detergent the W uses to clean their sheets.

The reception area, bar and restaurant are modern, low-lit and noisy, whereas once you get to the accommodation floors, the hotel seems to show its age a little, and the modern edge seems to disappear. My room was comfortable enough, but the bathroom was decidedly underwhelming for a hotel at this price point, and the shower was poor compared to similar hotels in the US.Staff were a mixed bag; some were very friendly and hwlpful, whereas on one visit for breakfast I felt more like I was being checked-in to the local correctional facility. Nevertheless, the quality of the food itself was good and portions were generous.The gym was reasonably spacious with decent equipment, but one or two pieces of equipment were out of order.Overall, it was a perfectly reasonable stay for a business trip, but I wouldn't rush back, particularly given the price I paid.",21-May-19,W Chicago - City Center,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d220240-Reviews-W_Chicago_City_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html

573,"Had two Suite Night Awards (SNAs) left over from 2018 and decided to apply them to this trip since I don’t often have two night stays. I submitted the request on Friday for an arrival the following Tuesday. Promptly received an automated email letting me know my request was received and someone from the property would be in touch shortly. Never heard anything from the hotel. When I checked-in, the lady at the desk told me I had been upgraded. However, the room I received was not what I had requested when I submitted the SNA. In fact, it wasn’t even a suite at all. Just an ordinary room on a mid-level floor with a view of the interior courtyard. I called Marriott customer service to have the SNAs refunded and they said I would have to talk to the front desk. Went back down to the front desk. They say they have no record of the SNA request. So I take out my phone to show her the confirmation email. She takes the phone into a back room to show the manager (guess manager could not be bothered to speak to me). Comes back a couple minutes later and says I can have SNAs refunded or they will give me a suite. I’d already dropped my stuff off so I said just refund the SNAs to my account please.After I got back to my room, it occurred to me; “If they have suites available, shouldn’t I have been offered one at check-in simply based on my elite status (titanium)?” According to the terms of the program, I should have. This property is obviously not following the rules.Rewards program cheating aside, the hotel itself is just average. This was my first stay at a W and I had been under the impression that it was a luxury brand. It most definitely is not that. It’s more like a budget airline where they charge you for every little nicety, wrapped up in “hip” packaging. There was a mini bar/snack bar in my room. The why the items where casually displayed on the table, I almost thought they where complimentary. Then I spotted the menu. Ten dollars for a pack of peanut M&Ms (plus $3 service charge). Even by hotel standards, that is insane. No sober person would pay those prices. They are really just taking advantage of unwitting and/or intoxicated guests.Also, as a “hip” brand you would expect the W to have the latest technology in room. This is not the case. No smart TVs, but you can buy pay-per-view and there was a DVD player in my room. Just like the 90s!Next time I will stay at the JW Marriott across the street.",30-Apr-19,W Chicago - City Center,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d220240-Reviews-W_Chicago_City_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html

When I returned from dinner, one of my two beds were covered with feather pillows! What a great surprise and a testament to going the extra mile.

I was sitting at my desk and thought maybe there was an earthquake at one point, but then realized the whole floor vibrates when any door closes.

582,"Lovely hotel in the city. I would have been happy to give it 5 stars, however deducted one star for location and for the tiny toilet room which felt like a closet. Aside from this, my room was large and the bed comfortable. I stayed on a weekend and the area is very quiet on the weekend with most things closed in the area. During the week is another story when the area is bustling. On saying this I was still able to walk to River North (25 minute walk) and the nearby theatre (15 minute walk) where more things were open, so it wasn't too bad. It's also a short cab ride to West Loop and the Fulton Market Area. I stayed here for some R&R, however was woken very abruptly by LOUD MUSIC coming from outside. I think there was some event on Sunday at 8:30am so wasn't too pleased about the early morning wake up on my day to catch up on sleep. It wasn't the hotel's fault, however it may be worthwhile checking that there aren't similar events in the area if you are planning to sleep in. I had breakfast in the cafe in the lobby. It was ok, however I felt the menu was limited and lacking of healthy choices. There were a couple, but really not many. Overall a good hotel.",30-Mar-19,W Chicago - City Center,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d220240-Reviews-W_Chicago_City_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html
583,"The staff was very gracious about early check in and concierge very friendly and help.However, there was an intermittent loud drill-like sound in the room. I asked to have someone sent to room to address the problem. When the engineer didn’t show, the frond desk person (who was very pleasant), offered to move me to another room. I said yes, though I was exhausted after a day of work. Both rooms had the same dated color school. I have stayed at W hotels elsewhere and enjoyed the funky vibe. The hotel lobby is beautiful but the rooms are more 1980s Holiday Inn. Last month I stayed at the Chicago Michigan Mile Aloft and the room was decorated much nicer than the one I am in. I also like the Chicago Gwen but didn’t want to spend as much. I come to Chicago often but it won’t be at the W (which usually are much better). I’m here for 2 nights and I’lol see how it goes. That said the hotel rooms badly need a renovation. It unfortunate the W hotels appear to be so uneven in quality.

It was the best decision ever!We arrived Monday, December 31, 2018 around 3:30pm, valet parked our car, and headed inside to check in. There was no wait, the front desk staff were all cordial and welcoming. We stayed in room 1207. The room was a nice, with a king sized bed, and city view. It has a modern chic feel too it. I loved the inspirational light box in the room (I’ve enclosed a picture below). We also had late check-out which was at 2pm. The only cons to the room were the following: 1) a mildew smell when we first went in, but as soon as we turned on the heat, it went away. 2) the walls are paper thin, we could here our neighbors having sex 5 minutes after arriving to our room. The area for registration to the party was nice and the registration process for VIP wristbands went smoothly. The scanners for general admission were having technical difficulties which caused the line to be a little backed up. The venue set up for the NYE Soirée was fabulous. There were 2 rooms equipped with djs and buffets. The VIP room had a female dj and she did a great job at keeping the party going and playing a mix of songs to keep the crowd engaged. The bar served delicious strong drinks (I hate watered down drinks). The arrangement of food and dessert at the buffet area were delicious as well. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 5 and had a blast ringing in 2019 at the W Hotel.

614,"I had the pleasure of visiting Chicago in January along with four of my best friends. The trip was a Christmas gift from our wives who chose Chicago for its central location as well as our affinity for the sports scene. We were lucky enough to be in town in the days following another Winter Classic featuring the Blackhawks and for the Bears home wild card game as we explored The Wheelhouse Hotel in anticipation of the upcoming baseball season. The hotel is conveniently located close to Wrigley Field, the CTA, and numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is nicely decorated with baseball décor and with a flair for the nostalgic. The bunk rooms were small with just enough room for sleeping and getting ready. The sliding door to the deck outside one of our rooms would not lock despite reporting the disabled latch to hotel staff on multiple occasions. The security risk was mitigated by the fact that the room was on the second floor, but the door could still be accessed by anyone from either of the adjacent decks. We did not eat at the hotel and I cannot attest to the food. We did stop for drinks and the bar staff was friendly and fun.My disappointment in The Wheelhouse Hotel is with the management, their questionable integrity, and their disregard for customer service. My wife booked two rooms for three nights and paid $919 in advance. My wife was unaware that an error went unresolved at the time of booking when she adjusted the reservation from one room to two rooms. As a result of the error, I was charged $481 for a third room upon check out. The erroneous charge was explained to hotel staff in an effort to reverse the error through traditional customer service channels, but management decided to proceed with using my signature on file for incidentals to charge me for a reservation I did not make and lodging that was not provided. The misleading presentation of the charge by the hotel cofounder during the dispute process is very concerning. I am left feeling like an unwelcome guest whose patronage is valued less than the opportunity for exploitation. Ultimately, the principle matters more than the money. My wife says she is upset that her Christmas gift cost me $481 and she is afraid that the trip was ruined. I have assured her that the trip was a fantastic success and that we are still eagerly anticipating our return to Chicago during the upcoming baseball season. At least we learned where not to stay. Go Cubs! See you at the Zachary.",2-Apr-19,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

Highly recommend .room rates on nights when the Cubs are NOT in town are reasonable.There is an interesting bar and restaurant on the ground floor.

624,"Stayed for a November weekend on a family visit and wife and I both loved the place. We could only imagine what it would be like for a Cubbies fan to book a room here during the season, buy Cracker Jacks in the lobby and walk to Wrigley! Loved the way the room was furnished, everything was premium. One knock--the pokey elevator. But they even posted a sign warning that if you're rushing to the game, you'd be better off taking the stairs. We did take them down, from fourth floor, even though there was no game, and it was no problem.",28-Nov-18,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

633,"I did a search to find a reasonably priced hotel close to the Aragon for three NIN concerts. Yep 3! This hotel is gorgeous. The street view is nothing to brag about but the room is super sweet and very comfortable. Yeah, the tile in the foyer is a bit loud when someone runs their suitcase wheels across, but whatever. The ""closet"" is nice, plenty of room (and shelves/safe) for your belongings... just different from typical hotels, but this hotel isn't typical. The lobby is really nice with lots of casual seating and the restaurant next door is very good, great pizza! The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. I don't do Cubs games or Wrigley (unless it's a concert like the Foo Fighters!) but I will definitely look into this hotel in the future and so should you!",19-Nov-18,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
634,"First a big shout out to the folks at the desk who not only let me check in a bit early but then pleasantly allowed me to change rooms when I discovered my room was very loud. This is probably due to the lovely high ceilings that let in lots of light but can create a bit of a bowling alley effect when the room above yours is being cleaned.( I did not want to find out what it sounded like when my upstairs neighbors came in from partying at 1 a.m. ) My fourth floor room was a wee bit smaller (with the sink in the room rather than in the bathroom...more on that later.) Both rooms were immaculately clean, pleasantly furnished with big windows that opened to the front, electronic drapes, upscale toiletries,gigantic bathroom (again...my sink was in the room for some strange reason) and a wonderfully firm king size bed with a fluffy duvet. All good. Here's the little things they could work on in order to get a full 5 stars: The sink in the room is actually not a big deal--sort of European--but having no where to put your toiletries is. I pulled over an ottoman and laid my stuff on there. That meant that I couldn't use said ottoman as a suitcase rack. Fine. So I started to take all my stuff out of the suitcase so I could just stash it in the closet. No closet. What you have is an open armoire with hanging space (and two really cushy bathrobes--nice) but no drawers or shelving. No drawers on the nightstands either. And about those cool sort of catcher's mask/locker room bedside lights? They are way too dim and throw shadows all over the room. Good thing I had an ereader and not a plain old book. Shower is huge....but no shelf for the soap or lovely toiletries. It's like the person who designed the room got so carried away with making it look cool (and it does) that they forgot someone was actually going to have to live in there for a few days. The ventilation issues mentioned in other reviews seemed to be somewhat resolved in my room but you don't have any control of the room temperature which is weird but not an issue for me. The lounge of the hotel is also cool baseball theme but poor kitchen ventilation in the adjoining restaurant meant that everything smelled like French fries all the way up the elevator shaft. Kinda gross after a while. All these little annoying things add up but that said, I'd stay here again, given its great location and upscale flair in an under-served part of town.",24-Oct-18,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
635,"I was very lucky to find The Wheelhouse Hotel on Expedia for a good price. It’s a great boutique hotel, even if you’re not planning to go to Wrigley, which is only a long block away. The hotel and its rooms have a cool baseball theme, but in an authentic (not cheesy) way. The staff was amazingly friendly. I certainly recommend staying here during any season, not just baseball season. I will be back, but I’m afraid it will be hard to book because of its guaranteed popularity!",6-Oct-18,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
636,"The hotel has a few bugs that need to be worked out. First of all found earbuds plugged in in our bathroom, not sure how they cleaned the room and did not see this. We stayed in room 305 and the shower door does not seal and all the water pours out into the bathroom and floods the floor. When we checked in at about 4:00pm on a warm day our air conditioning unit did not work so maintenance came up and advised that they would have to fix it at the main panel, so soon after the air came on and was set on 67 degrees, this was ok at the time but then in the morning the thermostat was still on 67 and was locked so we could not change it. All in all it was not a nice as we had expected.",25-Sep-18,The Wheelhouse Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d15023315-Reviews-The_Wheelhouse_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
637,"We were led to believe a kitchenette suite could sleep four. It certainly could not. The couch cot was so tiny it barely fit my toddler. An adult would not be able to sleep on it, let alone two. We had two adults and a toddler in the room and it felt crowded, partially because of the double bed for us. The bathroom is tiny and does not have a tub. The air didn’t work well in any room (we were with two other couples all on different floors). They kept snacks out last time we were there three years ago, but definitely skimped this time. There were only two pillows on the beds, and the elevators took literally 15 minutes to call. It increased in price but decreased in quality, so it was disappointing overall. Also, we were given a voucher for an upgrade but it was not available when we arrived so they told us we could have a late checkout, but we had to leave at noon anyway. No compensation was given. Great location, and if you’re traveling alone it might be ok.

The staff was gracious and were able to put us in a river front view room on request but it was old and very small. We had to change rooms midway through our stay and they moved us into a bit better room. The restaurant shown on the website is now a block away at the Hilton Garden Inn. There are two other restaurants a step from the door. We ate at the Corner Bakery quite a bit (fresh, quick & inexpensive). The coffee machine in the 2nd floor lounge is nice and the wine hour at 5 pm a pleasant perk.

648,"My friend and I visited on Memorial Day Weekend. We had the Double/Double room. It was clean, nice and spacious. Our bathrooms were a little small, but the space was well utilized. The room itself was clean and big for hotels in that area. It looked like it had been two rooms with a wall knocked out and a sliding door added. We each had our own bathroom, which was great. The walls were thick and I think that the only time we heard our neighbors were one time when they were coming or going. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known anyone else was around us. The rooms have wireless locks, and there was an option to add it to your phone via the app. I wish I would’ve tried it, but I didn’t. There were also refillable water bottles near the hotel in each floor. The idea was cool and we definitely used it. The only issue we had was with having to wait 20 minutes for our luggage that we had held by the bellhop before our room was ready for check in and after we checked out but were still going out before our flight. I believe they hold the luggage on a completely different floor and when we arrived early Saturday, the bellhop was always helping with valet. I guess my only recommendation for management would be to have a second person helping on busy weekends, but I guess you can’t always help being short staffed. I did let management know via a survey to access the WiFi and they contacted us and rectified it immediately, which I honestly didn’t even expect. Aside from the long wait for our luggage, the staff was friendly and helpful and the room was nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others!

First, the good - dropped the car with the valet ($53.00 fee) right at the front door, check in was quick and efficient, hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the bed was very comfortable. Location is ideal, the entire city is walkable from here. Now the not so good - the room was microscopic, think cruise ship small, 150 square feet or so. I traveled alone and for only one night so this was not a big deal. Multiple nights or travelling with another person and the room size/bathroom size would be problematic. One of the two elevators was down, leading to long wait times and frequent stops. Room had a coffee maker and hairdryer but the towel quality and limited room furnishings were not top shelf. There was really no place to hang out/sit in the lobby so it is not a hotel to linger/meet. It was not clear at check in what or where the in house dining options were, so I did not use them. There are many restaurants nearby though.All in all, if you are in town for one night and are just looking for a place to sleep, the River Hotel works. If you are looking for a full service hotel with lounges and amenities, this is not the choice.

The internet works well, and the lobby has ornate, high-class decor! Unfortunately, this place has some drawbacks too. The rooms are quite tiny and very pricey. One of the elevators was down while I stayed which made for very long trips from my room to the lobby. The beds are not all that comfy. Lastly, I couldn't see any rivers from my room. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, so you could walk to quite a bit of the city from here. Parking is $53/night, so I'd definitely recommend taking public transportation here.

655,"We were welcomed in a very friendly manner by the staff and they did their best to give us rooms close to each other. We visited with a party of 4 and although we all booked the same room they differ a lot in size. Apparently I had the biggest room with microwave and all (1101) and my colleague the smallest no fridge no microwave (1104). To me not completely fair to pay the same price.Other than the different sizes the rooms are clean, the beds are good and they are well maintained!The location was perfect for us. In good walking distance of the office and all shopping streets like State and Michigan. There were some nice breakfast places around the corner and the bean is also close by.The only real negative I have is regarding the airport service. We asked the reception to arrange a car for us to the airport and the arranged one form the hotel. We asked upfront how much and if we could pay with card which were both answered with yes. When in the car there was no machine for card payment, that could have been a sign for us, but we went with it anyway. Upon arrival at the airport the driver said: no card payment possible please go to the ATM and it was 20 dollars more expensive than agreed upon at the hotel. After we made a little fuzz about it he reduced the price with 10 dollars, but still kept on discussing with us which felt a little intimidating.

The bathroom was spacious and very clean. The staff were friendly and efficient, nothing seemed to much bother. The location is very good, very easy to get around. It is a shame that the in-hotel restaurant was closed for renovation, but there are plenty of other places to eat in the vicinity. One slight complaint would be the draughty window in the room.

The $10 a night upgrade to a superior room was worth every penny. A super comfortable bed, a mini fridge, a coffee maker, and a microwave were nice surprises. Thank you, Ryan for taking care of me during check in. You made it smooth and easy. The second floor lounge with coffee and snacks was a great bonus, as was the M-Th wine and cheese happy hour from 5-6. All in all, one of my best hotel stays ever. No complaints at all.

EVERYONE in the hotel (staff from top to bottom) is friendly and offers assistance and kindness. Extra credit for the building's historic value! Our only very small negs are difficulty in operating the high-tech TV's (we're not tech savvy, in fairness), and no partition or door between the two bedrooms which seemed a little funky.

Michigan Avenue and the Mag Mile, yes only a block away, so you can shop, shop, shop. Millennium Park is short walk down Michigan Ave as well with the Art Institute close by.

Hotel is clean, staff was friendly, and everything went well. Many snacks and drinks were provided free of charge on the 2nd floor. The only issue we had was we were called at 12:30am in our room by the front desk to explain that we weren't actually checked in when we checked in. They were calling to make sure we were actually there. My wife and I were both sleeping and were woken up by the call. I feel like this could have been done differently (maybe call in the morning or slip a note under the door) but because we were tired we were able to go right back to sleep and therefore didn't make a fuss about it (had we not got back to sleep then we would have made a fuss).

There were none available until the following night, but they did transfer us to that room once it became available, at no charge. Our rooms were good sizes, however the bathrooms were a little small. Rooms do have televisions you can connect your phone to in order to watch Netflix, which was nice too.

I was very happy with the breakfast that was provided. My room was very comfortable, and contained a microwave and refrigerator. The shuttle van was definitely a bonus. Not only was there a shuttle van, but it operates 24 hours each day - at least that's what the shuttle driver told me. I've never known any hotel to have a shuttle that operates 24 hours each day, so this was very special. If you like to use public transportation as I do, you'll love the fact that the bus stops are right out front. The cost per night was very reasonable for what I received.

721,My husband and I stayed at this hotel the 2nd week in oct . We found the staff to be very helpful and extremely friendly. Our first contact with the hotel was the reception area and Israel was a walking encyclopaedia It didn't matter what we asked he knew the answers and he was that way with everybody who came to the reception. All the staff at reception acknowledged both myself and my husband every time we either entered or exited the hotel which was a pleasant change Maggie in the Breakfast Room was so friendly and you could tell that she enjoyed her work. There was always plenty of food and always hot.The shuttle was great and the drivers helpful and friendly coffee and chilled flavoured water on tap 24 hours.

734,"Picked this hotel because of how close it is to Toyota Park Stadium (about 5 miles), Price was affordable and advertised an outdoor pool and continental breakfast. Overall the hotel common areas were clean and organized. Our room specifically could have been better. The air conditioner/fan was super loud to the point we had to turn up the TV almost to max in order to hear it. At night we either had to sweat or be kept up by the noise of it. When asked for a different room, I was told no other rooms were available (understandable). The sink in the bathroom drained very slowly as well making before and after bed routines kind of annoying. The beds were comfortable and clean. The hotel itself was pretty quiet, but Cicero Ave right outside was noisy. Plenty of parking and it was nice that it was included with our reservation. The seasonal outdoor pool was closed, in July, so I wonder what season it is open. If I had known the pool was not functioning, I would have reserved elsewhere. Continental breakfast was your run of the mill spread: cereal, yogurt, waffles. They also served some form of egg and sausage. It was not the best, but it got your belly full to start the day with. The hotel is located in a lower-end type neighborhood, so take your valuables inside with you and don't leave them unattended. We had no issues in doing this. Hotel is smoke free, with a smoking area off to the side of the entrance. We were given a code for free wi-fi, but it only worked for laptops, could not get our phones to connect and desk offered little help. Desk staff was accommodating, but not overly friendly, I think only one person said hello to us after checking in... and we were there for three days. Offered a concierge service, but we did not take advantage of it and chose Uber instead, usually there was a driver within five minutes. Would I stay again? Probably not, unless I am going back to Toyota Park, otherwise, this location is too far away from any of the sites in Chicago.",10-Aug-16,Quality Inn Midway Airport,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87610-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Midway_Airport-Chicago_Illinois.html

This is a multi story hotel that could use some upgrades, rooms were a good size with microwave, fridge and coffee. Good beds and flat screen TVs. Bathroom was clean but some wallpaper was pealing. Breakfast was hot and plentiful and as stated free shuttles. Pool looks closed for good but it's outside so not really that great.

We were offered another room which wasn't much better than the first, but at least there were no ""noticeable"" stains. The new room had a foul odor and the room’s furniture and fixtures were severely worn. We were offered a $50 discount for ""our troubles."" We were not contacted by the Hotel Manager, as requested, and there was no additional care or consideration shown by staff about our discomfort. Additionally, we were called names by hotel staff serving breakfast.

745,"If you like ""amenities"", this is probably not your ideal place. The pros- Location. Could not ask for a better location, walking distance to everything, including a train station to get you to places that aren't walking distance. Ditka's steakhouse is fantastic. The concierge was very helpful. The cons? Our room was basically big enough for a queen size bed and that's about it. It was small enough that when you rolled over on said queen size bed, you turned on the motion activated light in the closet. Not a big deal, right? Just close the closet door. Well yes, but then the poorly wired fan would mysteriously kick the light on and change speed. Real fun at 3 a.m. There are zero amenities. No hotel valet. You have to get a valet from the restaurant to park your car, because good luck finding a parking space in Chicago. However, when you pay $67 a night for valet service, you'd expect a garage, not to find your car parked two streets over on the street. Room service? Nope. Continental breakfast? Yes actually, but for $12.99. Yes, $12.99 for some OJ and a box of cereal. Of course there are plenty of restaurants around (my favorite was the original pancake house) so that didn't even matter.

There was black mold in the bathroom, no hand soap in the rooms, and the tubs were covered in brown, orange, and pink colored substances.

There was miscommunication on checkout time and though we had left the room early and packed our things, we left them in the room thinking we had more time. Because I misread that they charged us an additional$126 for 1/2 day. I communicated to the manager who offered to refund 1/2. Though this hotel is convenient to things I would not go back,due to all the extra fees and how this was handled. I had a much better experience through Airbnb.

759,"The purpose of our stay was to be in the city for the hot chocolate run so we weren't looking for anything over the top. This hotel is average and a basic place to lay your head if you're not planning on spending too much time in your room. What I don't understand is why valet is $67 for such a basic hotel. The Tremont isn't on par with say the Four Seasons around the corner to be able to charge that much but okay... One thing I didn't love as that you had to ask for soap as there was no soap in our room and upon getting said soap it was the tiniest little sliver of soap you've ever seen. We asked for 2 because there wasn't one in the shower either. That was a bit annoying. The location is the only thing positive that I could definitely confirm. Oh let's not forget the $9.99 ""resort"" fee which I'm honestly still not sure what it was for as there weren't resort-like amenities. The room was dated with lots of furniture scrapes, dings in the wall and tiny square footage.

762,"Upon arrival, the hotel is advised that my confirmed room was no longer available. There was no provision from the hotel as to alternate booking or otherwise. They did not offer to ""walk"" me to another hotel. When I asked for this provision the answer was simply ""NO"".The reason given is that the room was booked through a third party and that they were oversold. I used my corporate travel site (they are owned by Expedia) and booked this room several weeks in advance. No one contacted my travel company to let them know that their mutual customer would not have a place to stay. To put me out like just wasn’t right. The hotel then passed the buck and advised me to contact the sales director. Her explanation as to why The Tremont decided to treat its guests this way was that it was beyond their control, and that they had contacted Expedia with plenty of time to rebook me. I do not find this to be at all credible as no proof could be provided. This hotel simply chose to cancel ""discounted"" reservations (mine was $450! hardly a discount!) in favor of customers that booked direct and at higher rates. If you book through a ""third party"" BEWARE. I was really looking forward to staying there and am completely shocked that this was being treated as just normal.

Also breakfast which was included was also charged again after the recetption desk had said dont worry about that we just fix it up when you check out ....still chasing that refund mths later .....so we travelled around the US 1000- Out of pocket waiting for it to be rectified ...Since been back in Aust & getting no reponse from management just trying to get our refund for the breakfast charges .....,8-Oct-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
765,"Firstly, I would like to say that most of the staff was pleasant. There is, however, a seemingly lifeless and rude person who's name is pronounced Day-jah who worked this past Monday night around 9pm. She needs training in customer service skills. I had to deal with her twice during our stay. Upon arrival, the initial room they offered us was dull and spiritless. The nice gentleman who was working the night shift transferred us to a suite in the next bldg at no extra cost! Initially, the suite was clean enough upon check in and the place was spacious. The shower has a nice strong pressure with a clean bathtub. The suite had remnants of unintentional old world character next to some remodeled elements i.e. the crown molding on the ceiling, painted walls, and the beds were clean and comfortable. The suite number is 411- labeled on the door. The ISSUE is- the cleaning team does an inadequate job on keeping the room clean. For instance, I've left several [clean] tissues or pieces of paper in certain spots to see if they would pick it up or vacuum. To my surprise, the pieces were there for the duration of our stay. The rug around the room was dark and looked filthy. Corners of the wash room had little hairs and lint which shows no attn was given to these areas. I would advise you to look at some other places before deciding on this one.",4-Oct-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
766,When I called to find out about $70 of extra fees on our credit card the front desk clerk Diana said she mentioned that the breakfast cost $12.95 pp and that there was a daily amenity fee of $9.99. But she wasn’t the one who even checked us in! The amenity fee she explained was for coffee and water in the room plus use of the business center. The room was really small. The front desk peronnel are cold and impersonal. The continental breakfast served from Ditkas next door is ok but be prepared to pay for it.

767,"We stayed in room 607. Realize that this is an older hotel, the halls are narrow. The decoration in the rooms was very soothing and modern, though I didn't care for the odd print that was facing the bed. They have a nice lounge area downstairs. Our door did stick, you needed to shove it pretty hard to open it, but we're pretty fit, so it wasn't a problem, though I can see this could present a problem for some customers. I agree that it would be nice to have a small fridge in the room and also that the toilets and vanity in the bathroom are very low. The best things about this hotel are the quiet and the location. Several great restaurants within a couple of blocks. The Hancock tower is a short walk away. 607 is a corner room, which means the windows let in a lot of light, which is very nice. The windows also open, the outsides were a little dirty, but I imagine that can happen pretty quickly in the city. All in all, a relaxing stay, with a great location. I found the staff to be rather neutral-not a lot of smiles, but our room, the elevators and the common area were very clean.",18-Sep-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
768,"Check in was quick & easy. Staff was very accommodating and polite. The room, however is a different story. Upon first entrance, I noticed it was VERY small (no more than 20x15). Definitely wasn’t $200 worth of room. I go to the bathroom and see the wall splitting from the tile & mold in the tub. The toilet was clean but sits very low. Vanity was clean, except the two rusted screws holding the bottom door shut. The room had no refrigerator or microwave, but it had a coffee maker. The bed was clean (checked under the covers) and comfortable. There is a nice little speaker next to the bed you can plug your phone into. The nightstands has some scuff marks on them. The windows opened but had spiders and webs right outside so I kept them closed. The closet was clean with a safe & the light automatically came on when the doors opened. There is water damage & bubbling on the ceiling and the A/C vent dropped water. Heat didn’t work. Best thing about this room was the TV which was fairly large, but it didn’t have a remote. Honestly, save your money and go somewhere else. It is not worth the price. You can get a WAY better room for the same price. They put up a good front but this hotel is dirty underneath.

Bed and pillows were so comfortable, you wish you could just stay in :-) The only CON would be that at the time of booking (and yes, the price was very good, too, I genuinely didnt expect such a quality for that price!!!) the website claimed WiFi was free, but it wasnt, It was 9.99 per day. But I will not hold this against the hotel, we just spent a night there and got a really good rest.

775,This is ideal for visiting the attractions and heading out and about. The red line underground is very close and by a McDonald’s to get a one dollar drink. The hotel is literally 500 yards from the 360 sky deck John Hancock building so go and have a cocktail and see the views it’s free on that floor to view. Head to the nearby beach and Lincoln park and navy pier and the magnificant mile as they are all close by. And head down and do the river walk or do one of the boat trips. You can also do the open top bus tour or head around on the busses and get a 7day pass. There is a great Italian right across the road and lots of local shops. Rooms are clean and tidy but be aware it’s nearly 10 dollars a night if you want WiFi. Have fine and recommend this hotel if your touring the city and just want a comfy bed.

I don't care if the rest of the experience is amazing (but considering my room didn't have toilet paper my hopes aren't very high). This is such an annoyance that its worth calling out the hotel and their 'new management' for a lousy policy. I travel a lot. More than most folks. No respectable hotel charges for internet anymore. The practice of charging customers for internet access is a dated money gouge limited to exploitive services like Boingo.

780,"I spent 2 nights in the Tremont on a business trip recently, during which time Chicago was experiencing unseasonably cold and cloudy/foggy weather. I made the mistake of bringing a pair of sunglasses with me, which ended up staying in the bathroom during my whole stay. On my way to the airport, keep in mind this was less than an hour after I checked-out, I realized that I had left my sunglasses in the bathroom in my haste to leave. I had returned from a successful business meeting out in Hoffman Estates, but due to several wrecks on the highway, I did not return to the hotel until the virtual last minute before I needed to be headed to the airport to make my trip home. About 20 minutes into the Uber ride, I realized my boo boo and immediately called the front desk of the hotel. I politely asked the front desk clerk to check my room (specifically the bathroom) as I had left my sunglasses there. She asked if I would like to turn around and come back to get into the room myself and I told her that I couldn't as I was more than halfway to O'Hare at that point and there was no way I could turn around and make my flight. So, I said I would give them my address and a CC number to pay for return shipping. She said she would call as soon as they found them. That call never came. My follow-up call to the hotel ended with a ""we never found them in your room, you must have not left them here."" Bull. Quite a disappointment that they couldn't take 2 seconds to walk into the room before the cleaning crew to find the missing item only to later have it ""never found.""",22-Jun-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
781,"Let’s start with the positives. The Tremont is in a great location, and the staff are super. It is a half block away from Michigan Avenue and very close to Water Tower Place. It is so easy to access the shopping and views afforded by being near the Magnificent Mile and shoreline. The staff are very friendly and helpful from the moment you check in until the moment you depart. For our business meeting, The Tremont also provided a very good rate for each night. That said, there were a few issues that makes me think this place needs a bit more TLC. Firstly, we tried to iron some clothes and thought the iron was broken after plugging it into two outlets. It turned out that neither socket was able to power the iron, which worked fine using the outlet in the bathroom. Next we had a bit of trouble with the closet door, which kept coming out of the track when we opened the door. The top hinge was not secured, and it was very loose, suggesting that the problem was identifiable well in advance of our visit. Next the toilet plugged without too much having been sent down the drain to plug it. This, the peeling paint in the bathroom, and the continual on and off of the toilet’s filling mechanism (suggesting that the flap was overdue for a replacement) made the bathroom feel a bit run down. I’ll finish with the staircase, which is a must have for me, as I prefer the exercise of climbing the stairs to the convenience of an elevator. The stairs were safe, and they were available, but the second and third floor area was worn and quite a bit grimy from use by kitchen staff that used the same stairs. A bit of cleaning and a coat of paint would go a long way to improve it and prevent guests from feeling a bit gross when climbing the stairs. Overall, I guess this place is okay, but I think a bit more TLC could make it much nicer and result in more generous ratings.

782,"We stayed in the Tremont Hotel in early June, 2018. We booked our room using SPG points several months earlier. We were notified within one month of our reservation that the hotel would no longer be affiliated with Starwood or Marriott, but that our reservation would be honored. That gave us some cause for worry as no reason was given. We were pleasantly surprised by The Tremont and very satisfied. Every encounter with a staff member was positive and made us feel special. The room was quiet, luxurious and a great refuge from the city. We had a king sized bed on the 10th floor with a west facing view. The bed was quite nice, the closet ample for a 6 night stay and the bathroom was well appointed. I'd read reviews about hallway noise--but we heard none of it. We did go for coffee several mornings, but never had the breakfast offered at Ditka's restaurant.

784,"Quick summary: comfortable room in a very good area for shopping, restaurants, near north beach. Ditka's restaurant and bar downstairs is a good option. Some minor room maintenance issues.Room 903 was a fairly spacious corner room that overlooked the back of the hotel and a side small park area. Very comfortable queen bed and assortment of pillows. Quality linens and towels. Large work desk and comfy work chair. This floor was labeled ""Starwood Preferred,"" which is nice, but I don't know how that might compare to floors that don't have that designation.Good closet and generous drawer space. No other chair than the desk chair. Iron and board, coffee/tea maker. Complimentary bottled water.Bathroom with tub/shower combination, which I love because I want a bath at the end of a long day. Nice toiletries of shampoo. conditioner, lotion, bath gel.Spotless housekeeping.The hotels.com reservation said there was a charge for wifi, but there was none for the little I needed it for email. There is an upcharge for faster service, which you may want if you do a lot of streaming. It felt a bit slow, even with just email, but that level is free.I would have rated this higher if the room was in better working order. The desk lamp had a missing ""on"" button, which made it useless. The painted desk/table could use another coat, and looked worn. The TV remote battery died within an hour that I used it. It was quickly replaced, but still...I got a room rate on hotels.com, so the lack of a robe didn't really bother me, but one would have been nice. No minibar or fridge. The room temperature was fine and quiet. However, the fan and overhead light switch was in an odd place in the entry foyer, which was dark, i.e. I couldn't tell which button I was trying to push.Excellent area very near the Water Tower and the Magnificent Mile of shopping. This place is on one of the less trafficked side streets, so the room was very quiet, but everything you'd like in easy walking distance - shops, restaurants and cafes, walk to north beach, etc. Very close to the Loyola downtown campus if you are visiting there.I enjoyed a dinner at Ditka's, which is in the hotel - restaurant and separate bar when the evening weather turned cold and dreary. Good for basic American favorites, steaks, burgers, fish & chips, meatloaf.Nice public rooms on the ground floor.So -- I'd consider staying here again as it was generally comfortable, but the management has a few relatively minor maintenance issues to deal with.",5-May-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

786,"I'm a Chicago-area resident who stayed here one weekend day/night for a ""staycation."" We stayed in room 509 which is near the elevator and close enough to the street that it was a really noisy room both as a result of inside and outside noise.Last time I was at the hotel was back on my wedding night in 1997 and ... well, some things that were nice then are not nice now. They've done a decent job of updating and creating a comfortable space in the lobby area, however that same feeling didn't really translate to all other experiences from the elevator to the guest rooms. Two things stood out to me as first impressions: First, the front desk staff—unlike other Starwood hotels—make no effort toward orientation with regard to the hotel or city. Is there a gym? Is there coffee in the lobby? Is there room service? A spa? Do they have partnerships with any nearby places if they don't have above? Do I want a map or dinner recommendations? No courtesies of any sort that are consistent with other Starwood properties. Second, Starwood clearly hasn't invested any money into even putting cosmetic improvements into the elevator area which reminded me of my college dorm elevator. It's pretty sad that they haven't even put a sign in there—something ... anything about Ditka's, for example?—or a nice photo or something? Really a bad oversight on part of Starwood and an expression of really not caring.The guest rooms appear to have gotten a Starwood-lite treatment, but things like old 80s ceiling fans, bathroom heat lamps, florescent bathroom lighting, and crazy old and loud bathroom fans—all completely different from overall decor—remain. And small conveniences that would cost Starwood very little, like coffee in the lobby in the morning, are missed opportunities for Starwood to offset the sub-Starwood room experiences. This said, the location is unbeatable and, if you're like me and only spend time sleeping in the room and the rest of the time exploring the city, these things can mostly be overlooked, which is why I gave it a 3 rating and not a 2. But anyone staying more than, say, 4 days will definitely find these things irritating.",15-Apr-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
787,"This was a great little boutique hotel off the Magnificent Mile, close to all the shops, restaurants and Loyola University. The location is perfect but the rooms need a bit of a refresh (old water damage very visible). Everything worked fairly well, the rooms were very clean and overall the value was okay. There’s a great restaurant/bar called Mike Ditka’s at street level (great food, drinks and the staff are fantastic), and Starbucks is across the street. Whatever you need it’s close by (Walgreens, pubs, Chicago deep dish pizza, etc). Hotel staff are also great and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel considering the price!",2-Apr-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
788,"The location of the Tremont hotel was excellent, just one block from Michigan avenue. The rooms were OK, although i found a spider web over my bed the night of my check in and the plumbing is old and needs replacing. The bed was comfy. On my last day, during the check out, there was a problem with my credit card for which the hotel was responsible, nor me nor my bank. So, the employee of the front desk wasn't helpful at all, she confronted me as i was a thief and attacked my country (Greece) because we don't know how the ""system"" works. When i asked for her manager to assist me, she solved the problem alone within 10 minutes.

The agent told me they were out of buckets and couldn’t help me in any way. I find that to have been unacceptable considering the class and cost of the hotel.

790,"I stayed here with a friend for their birthday and it was great. It's about two blocks from the Red Line Chicago St station on a side street. It's surrounded by great bars, a beautiful church, a ton of places to eat and its right on the Mag Mile in the middle of downtown. Within walking distance of everything one would desire to see in downtown Chicago. The rooms were clean and had necessary amenities and awesome comfy beds. The front desk was helpful and responsive at any time. They have a computer/printer and meeting rooms available to guests, and a small common area in the lobby, a fitness center and continental breakfast for $10/person available. Would definitely stay again.",27-Feb-18,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
791,"This hotel surprised me a little bit. I knew it was once a run down hotel that was purchased by SPG and went through a remodel. They did a good job with the lobby and it feels upscale and immediately welcoming. The room has a few drawbacks but considering I paid $89 all in with tax, this is a great option to be so close to Michigan Ave and Water Tower Place without the huge price tag. The lobby is wonderful and the hallways are fully remodeled and light and bright. The room has a few older fixtures in it but also has a new bed/head board, mattress, carpeting, art, etc. The bathroom is tiny but they had to work with what was there. It’s on the small side and they replaced a few cosmetic items but they didn’t gut it. For anyone who wants a comfortable room so close to Michigan Ave for a great price, you will overlook the bathroom and this hotel will fulfill all your needs. I uploaded several pictures of my room so you can judge for yourself.",28-Dec-17,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
792,"I booked one night at the Tremont because of an ""Express Deal"" on another site. I did some research on the hotel and was worried because of the mostly poor reviews. Luckily, I did not have a negative experience and enjoyed my evening at the hotel. The Tremont definitely could use a remodel to freshen up the place, it has so much potential especially being right off Michigan Avenue. When I entered my hotel room, there was a definite ""basement"" smell (may need to work on the ventilation system), but eventually that scent disappears. My room and the bathroom were very clean and I had plenty of hot water. The hotel staff were very friendly and polite and Mike Ditka's Restaurant is next door. There is also a Starbucks across the street and the hotel is very close the John Hancock, Water Tower Place and The MCA.",13-Nov-17,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
793,"Maybe this is what you get for $200+ a night in Chicago. Location was super, safe neighborhood, could walk to dinner, good restaurants in the area. but, hotel was tired, and staff poorly trained. Example: Upon check in, we looked for a choice of not having sheets and towels changed daily, but there was nothing, so on the first evening there, told front clerk we'd like to go ""green"" -- (his term). For the next two days, no one tided up the room at all. I emptied the waste baskets for two days and left the contents in the hallway. On the third day, the waster baskets had been emptied, the sheets changed and fresh towels were there. From going ""green"", the day before our four night stay, we had gone not green! The check in people were quite pleasant (if inefficient on occasions). I could go on with petty details, but overall, a disappointment.",13-Nov-17,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
794,"I read reviews and suspected I was going to be disappointed but I was trying to be positive. My room smelled, the bathroom was extremely dated, and the hallways and room were very depressing. There were a couple pieces of furniture and they were extremely scratched on top and looked awful. I recommend putting a glass top on the furniture so guests can’t damage it. I will not stay here again and I don’t recommend it to anyone. I expect more from an SPG property. As someone else mentioned, the hotel is old but it’s not an excuse for the condition of the hallways and rooms. I’m extremely disappointed in the amount of money I paid to stay here.",8-Nov-17,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
795,"The Tremont is in an excellent location, but to be candid, this is not for guests desiring a modern full service hotel experience. The building itself is very old and definitely reminds me of a pre-war NYC studio. The windows are thin and drafty, so you can definitely hear the rumblings of buses trucks below and during the day, the whistle from the bellboy hailing cabs. The bathroom seems to retain hardware from over 2 decades ago and could definitely use a face lift. Breakfast is served in the restaurant downstairs. They had hashbrowns and eggs in addition to a typical continental spread. Service is minimal as you sign into a sheet upon walking in.Overall, if you're looking for a place to sleep in an excellent location while touring Chicago, I recommend the Tremont. Their nightly rates tend to also be a lot lower than any other SPG property within a 1 mile radius. Again, if you are expecting a modern hotel with modern amenities and technology, you will be greatly disappointed.",2-Nov-17,The Tremont Chicago Hotel at Magnificent Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87656-Reviews-The_Tremont_Chicago_Hotel_at_Magnificent_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

So, I have grown accustom to the usually high SPG standard and typically go out of my way to stay in a SPG property. This hotel is in a amazing location, between Rush and Michigan Ave, beautiful building from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover. This hotel is horrible on the inside. My room, 608, had a horrible odor the moment I entered it, a damp, moldy odor. When I asked for another room, was told there was none. I found black mold, massive water damage in the ceiling in multiple places, such a loud ceiling fan sounded like an engine from the 1980s with no oil. Pictures to support everything.

803,"My husband and I were visiting Chicago from Missouri and reserved a regular room with a king bed at this hotel. We arrived around midnight, and the concierge was incredibly friendly and kind. She quickly checked us in and we went up to our room.When we walked in, we noticed it was a regular room with two queen beds instead of one king. We really didn't mind, but my husband went down to tell her in case we had accidentally taken somebody else's room. The hotel employee, Kelly, was very apologetic and said she would be happy to move us to our reserved room immediately. My husband told her we were completely happy with the current room, but he just wanted to let her know.When we were ready for a bed, we realized that it was pretty warm in the room-around 75° or so. We went to turn the air down, only to find out it was as high and cold as it would go. My husband went back downstairs and talked to Kelly and she quickly gave him a new room key for us which was an upgraded king suite!Aside from a burnt piece of popcorn on the floor in our first room and what I think was a dried booger on the bathroom wall in our second room, our trip was perfect. We could not have asked for a kinder or more compassionate hotel employee than Kelly. The rooms seemed clean and large, and we definitely will be staying here again for our future trips.Thank you, Kelly!",23-Jun-19,Chicago South Loop Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1075753-Reviews-Chicago_South_Loop_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

Within 15 minutes, Bernita (HouseKeeping Mngr), Elizabeth (Supervisor), and Edward were knocking on my door to correct the concern. What such great customer service...and might I add, they addressed the concern quite quickly. Out of a rating of 1-10, I would most definitely give them a 20!!!!

808,"This property is located on the South Side near the convention centre. The rooms are a decent size and very clean. The exterior is well maintained as is the lobby. The front desk staff are efficient and very helpful. It is one of the few properties near the loop and the River North area that provides complimentary parking. It is for that reason I rated this hotel as providing good value.Located approximately 4 blocks from the El (green line), access to the loop and Michigan Mile is a 20 minute ride away. The walk to the CTA station takes about 10 minutes but the route is desolate (I did not feel unsafe even in the evening - it's just there's absolutely no-one around). Alternatively there's a bus stop across from the hotel and the station is 3 stops away,Unfortunately, there are no dining options nearby. Although there are restaurants in the hotel, I prefer to eat elsewhere. That requires a trip on the El to the loop/River North areas. That is the only criticism I have of the hotel. Otherwise, I would recommend the hotel, especially because of the complimentary parking.

I stay there whenever I need to be at McCormick Place for a conference, more or less every spring. Free, safe parking is a major bonus. The rooms are clean, large and well-maintained. It feels like they may have been doing a refresh in the past year, and I enjoyed the results. It's walkable to McCormick or a $5 ride by Uber/Lyft, a bit more by taxi.

831,"This hotel is located in the South Loop of Chicago. The hotel is fairly large and easy enough to find. Our friendly taxi driver who took us from the airport to the hotel was very informative and advised us to be careful at night because [the hotel is situated in the ""Southside"" district which can be somewhat dangerous for tourists.] This view was shared by the staff at check in who advised not walking around after dark. That said, we didnt experience any trouble nor did we feel unsafe (but perhaps thats because we took the advice and didnt walk around the streets after dark). The check in process was fairly quick and first appearances of the hotel were good. Our room on the 2nd floor was a standard double room with 2 beds. It was spacious, although I would say that [the rooms are in desperate need of refurbishment as they are very outdated, dimly lit and the wardrobes and furnishing in the bathroom were quite beat up and damaged]. That said, perhaps not all the rooms are in this condition. Our room key initially did not work and we had to wait 20mins for maintenance staff to come and reconfigure the locks. The bathroom was fine although again, a refurb would be welcome. We had a quiet nights sleep despite there being a huge annual music festival in Chicago which meant the hotel was full of festival crowds. Id also say that the rooms were acceptable in terms of cleanliness but given that a lot of the fitting have clearly been around for at least 20 years, you may question cleanliness. Our room was acceptable for the 2 nights we stayed, I wouldnt be so confident that all of the rooms are the same acceptable standard. In terms of value for money, Id say the hotel was OK and it certainly was one of the lowest priced hotels in the area at the time (given the inflated prices across Chicago due to the festival). In all honesty, I pronably wouldnt stay here again. However if youre looking for a base to stay and sleep then consider this hotel. I wouldnt have too high expectations and this hotel serves fine as a base to explore Chicago if you can forgive the outdated style and youre not phased by the area.",18-Feb-19,Chicago South Loop Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d1075753-Reviews-Chicago_South_Loop_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

844,"We have visited Chicago numerous times and hate paying for parking even at hotels, so finding this one with parking included was like winning the lottery. We also checked it's location for what we wanted to do while in Chicago and it was in a nice location, easy on/off from freeways to get to our daily destinations. We booked through a travel site, not directly through the hotel and didn't have any problems. We arrived and our room was ready. The rooms were big enough for the four of us to spread out and have space with all of our luggage. We had to ask for a 4th towel, since there were four of us and only 3 in the room.After the first day, our towels were removed, but not enough left and the soap wasn't ever replaced in the 4 days we stayed. Our beds were made after the first day, but never again, although our garbage was emptied each day. The wifi was really good, until it totally gave out the last night we were there. We probably would stay here again just because of the connivence and parking availability. We walked to Chinatown two nights, and it wasn't that much of a walk.

It is a little far from the conference center to walk so you will want to take an Uber. There are a few sketchy buildings around it but the hotel itself was fine. Parking was also free which was nice since the conference center charged $35 a night to park.

849,"This place was a lot better than I expected, considering the average rating was 3 stars. Grant it, it’s an older hotel, they still do a good job in making sure the rooms are clean and it smells nice. For the value (through Expedia) this is a bargain as they offer FREE PARKING in a secured lot and it is very close to downtown. No other hotel offers free parking. In fact, most places charge almost as much to park as they do for the room.We had came for the Bears vs Rams game GO BEARS!!! and this hotel was 2 miles away, a 5-10 minute ride to Soldier Field.As for the room itself, they offer direct tv channels with hbo, some soaps, hair dryer, fridge, coffee maker, towels, house keeping, free WiFi, and it was a clean room were I felt comfortable sleeping. It was very spacious. The only things I could think of that could be improved are the lighting/ tv could be updated, and maybe less springy beds. However; the price point of the room is so reasonable so It’s not a dealbreaker as the accommodations aren’t bad at all. Lastly, the front desk staff are really nice. I believe a lady named Camille checked us in on Saturday 12/8/18 and an Asian lady checked us out ( forgot to get her name), both ladies were extremely pleasant and helpful! In fact they extend check out for free for two hours and were more than kind enough to hold our luggage all day even after the check out time!

Great lounge/bar/lobby area to hang out and catch up on emails and chat with other out of towners. The front desk staff were always happy and helpful.

Didn’t use the fitness room but it looked nice. Did use the pool with the fam. At first I felt like the pool would be a baby pool since it’s shallow but it was actually great for a dip with the kids. I also couldn’t find the info on the website but they do have a small mini fridge in the room. Great location for catching the bus down to Shedd or Field Museum as well (6.25 total fare one way for 2 kids 2 adults).

At 4:00 pm that day, front desk told me abruptly that housekeeping leaves at 5 and wouldn't make up room. Said ""he would ask but knew what the answer would be."" Next day a totally half hearted effort after asking for them to not to miss our room at front desk. Garbage cans thrown where convenient, no coffee, no cups etc., bed barely made. Someone managed to drop a baggy on the desk later that night with coffee after I called down and again no apologies for poor service. Woken 1 morning with housekeeper yelling on her phone in hallway in front of our door, arguing with another staff member. Sweet.

Beyond that the elevator is so slow, average wait time was 3 minutes. Worst was the 10 minutes I had to wait for an elevator during the morning rush. We gave management a chance to make good only to get shrugged shoulders. Corporate wasn't any help either.

EMC2 was full, so I chose this place because I had a free Bonvoy night and it was so close to the other hotel.Check-in was nice and easy. Friendly staff.The room is quite small. No real separation between bathroom area and sleeping area, which means if one person is awake, brushing teeth or whatever, the other person won't be able to sleep.Not much water pressure in the shower. No closet, ridiculously loud toilet. Street noise, too.There was a mini fridge, with free bottled water.The bed was comfy, and the room had a decent view. Also, they gave us late checkout which we were able to combine seamlessly with early check-in across the street.Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel, but it served the purpose for a one-night stay. Okay place for someone who just needs a clean, comfy place to sleep. I would call it ""industrial chic."" There was one concrete wall, and a concrete ceiling.

866,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel over the weekend to watch BTS perform at Soldier Field. I love the ALoft concept: unabashedly challenging traditional hotel notions of generally accepted requirements while incorporating notions of sensibilities and efficiency. Instead of small bottles of shampoo/conditioner/soap in the shower, they offer the items via economically green pumps on the wall. If you choose to go ""green"", you can hang a placard on the outside of your door indicating you are skipping maid service, and in return you get $5 off of the snack service in the lobby or on your next stay for each day that you go green. Perfect for the modern, no frills necessary traveler. We had no problems with the bed, pillows, temp, or noise. The toilet is loud but nothing to complain about. Extra shout outs to Ishmael and Julianne when my daughter and I discovered our smart fridge was a non-working one - which we didn't discover till after day two when our food had to be thrown out (we thought pressing the ""on"" button on the fridge meant it would turn on :). They went above and beyond by providing friendly understanding service and comping us with free coffee and snacks from downstairs, and the snacks are GOOD. Enjoyed the exercise room with the Peloton!

872,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my kids and they loved it. The room,pool and lobby were all clean and bright spaces. My kids loved the pool table in the lobby. The hotel guests on a Saturday night were made up of families or young partiers. At first this made me a little uneasy by Sunday the crowd was a little more calm. Personally I prefer a little more luxury but the location was perfect and the staff was very helpful. Juliana at the front desk went out of her way to surprise us with a welcome gift. Would recommend this hotel. ",9-Apr-19,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
873,"This place is wonderful! We got a great last minute rate of only $89. a night! There were three of us and there was plenty of room for us and our luggage. I love that there is no gross ""hotel carpet"" and the decor is simple and pleasing. The bathroom has amenities in pumps for the shower--a great concept over the small bottles usually found in hotels. We chose to add breakfast ""pots"" for an extra $10.and they were delicious. Free coffee and cold brew in the morning was a plus. There is also a pool table and games available to use. A very inviting Lobby area with a full bar as well. We parked around the corner on Ohio street for $20. for 24 hours--a great deal in a safe clean indoor parking lot.

874,"Stayed for three nights with my family. Our room was modern, quiet, clean, and comfortable. We had a great view on the 11th floor. The tv was huge and we enjoyed relaxing in bed during our rare downtime. The shades kept everything dark when down and let lots natural light in when up thanks to the floor to ceiling windows. Large bathroom and shower with plenty of hot water. Pool was closed our first night. Overhead someone say that a glass was broken in it so they had to drain it. The second night it was closed because they were refilling and heating it. We went in the third night and it was still quite cold. Our son still enjoyed it though. We wish it was open the other nights but not the hotels fault. They were handling things. They did offer a pass to swim at a different hotel but we declined due to the inconvenience.Location was great! Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Museums and other attractions were a short Uber ride away. Great stay! We had a very positive experience and would definitely stay here again.

875,"This has to be the first hotel I have stayed at that I did not get any sleep. The sheets were beyond itchy, there were flashing lights from the smoke detector and 2 other places in the room. The windows must be paper thin, you could hear every siren.. all..night..long. No book in the room so you know nothing about the hotel. The bathroom door was broken. Was charged an incidental fee but never was told that nor did I receive any kind of receipt. Ice bucket in room but could not find an ice machine. Only thing good is the lobby and location.

876,"Listen fam, St Patricks Day in Chicago can be a lot. Without getting too into details I'll just say that the receptionist Michael serves as both a profesh-ass white glove service hotel overseer, and a straight up guardian angel. Kind, attentive, helpful and hilarious, this man went above and beyond to calm a crisis (of our own doing, not his!) and ensure we had the best stay possible. He was there in a pinch, and then 30 minutes after, and then two hours after that when we needed him. The place is clean, super hip and intentionally curated, but it's the people who work there who will bring me back.

I can’t thank Everence enough for making sure every part of our stay was top notch!! Everence was very welcoming and checked on both my mother and I to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.

879,"We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 pm, check-in was at 3. Even though they had rooms ready, they wanted to charge us an additional $25 to check in an hour and a half early. I stay in Chicago multiple times a year, and have never experienced this before. When we got in the room, it was not clean. Underwear left in the drawer from the previous guest, a gum wrapper with gum, and loose tobacco all over the coffee pot station. We did not want to go through the hassle of moving rooms, so we just stayed. We mentioned this at check out, and instead of offering us any type of compensation, she just said that we should have let them know and they would have moved us. I guess it’s our fault they didn’t clean the room properly? There was no hot water in the shower the entire time we were there. There is no closet to hang clothes. Just about a half dozen hangers on a rack. No iron and ironing board. Just a steamer that leaked water all over my clothes. Mattresses were as hard as a rock. At check out, we check our bags at the front desk because we were going to be in town a few more hours. When we picked them up the front desk gave us someone else’s bag in addition to ours. Being that we had many bags we almost didn’t realize it. Just as we were getting ready to head to the train station we did. The staff is very unprofessional and incompetent. It was apparent that most of them had never worked in a hotel prior to this one (or at least seemed that way). We will not be staying here again!

884,"Overall, we had a good stay at the Aloft Chicago Mag Mile. As soon as we entered, we liked the beautiful and modern design. The lobby is huge and bright, with beautiful colors and a nice bar. A guy at the guitar was playing live music, which we liked very much. The Check-in itself was good as well, fast and painless. The room itself was very warm (it was very cold outside, so we enjoyed that). Like the lobby, it's colorful and very modern. A place to enjoy. The rooms have huge TV's inside. At this moment, the cleanliness was alright. The carpet was moreless clean and the bed looked very clean. However, the room got dirtier and dirtier from day to day. On the streets was much dirt, because of all the snow and the salt on the streets. But they never really cleaned our room. We stayed for one whole week and our room was never really clean. We event went to the reception 3 times. We never heard a simple ""sorry for that"". Not once! That was one part which for me personally is unacceptable. At the front desk, they always reacted always ""cool"" but not helpful at all! The stuff became a real pain for us. We complained more than once, but the room stayed dirty for the whole week. Within 7 days, the bed sheets was only changed once! And that on our request. The staff at the bar was exactly the same. Not unfriendly but not helpful at all. Location goodPool goodDesign goodCleanliness badStaff friendly but not helpful at allI wouldn't especially look for that hotel on my next trip to Chicago. But if it's really less expensive than other hotels in that class, it would be alright. It's a beautiful modern hotel, we just had a few problems. But overall it's nice. PS. Please clean your microwave, it's just too dirty! We were scared to make our food in that!

886,"Flew in with wife and 2 kids (teens) for a long weekend in Chicago. Decided on Aloft which was opened a few months ago. Similar to other Alofts I have stayed at previously. They have very contemporary feel with the rooms, same bar in lobby, pool table etc. the staff was very helpful the entire time from restaurant recommendations, directions and even finding a drug store. The weather wasn’t very good so we ended up taking Uber instead of walking and also valet for our car ($62/day....ouch). We had adjoining rooms that worked perfect. HUGE TVs. Floor to ceiling windows. Easy walk a couple blocks to mag mile.

887,"Stayed at the Aloft Mag Mile for a two night weekend stay with a friend. We chose this hotel because we had heard good things about the Aloft brand, the location and it was very well priced. We arrived right around check in time, the agent was friendly and added my Marriott rewards number to the booking (even though I had booked through different website). We weren't really given any information about the property (hours things are open, fitness center details etc.) but overall check in was fine. Our room was on the 7th floor. It was actually quite large for a city hotel and the decor met the ""loft"" concept (very industrial and funky). GIANT TV, nice small fridge etc. Not a lot of places to store/hang things but as we were only staying 2 nights that wasn't really an issue. The room was clean (though if you looked really closely there were a few areas that could use a good scrub..like around the sink). Relatively quiet considering we were facing a busy street, beds were comfortable. Only small problem with the room - it was hard to keep the room a consistent temperature (though it was REALLY cold out so I kind of get why) and the water never got really hot. We had hoped to use the bar area more (or at least once) because it did look really fun but just didn't work out. We tried Saturday night...sat down at 11:45pm...one bartender came over to say hello and indicated he'd be right back. A few minutes later another bartender came over and said they were closed...since 11:30pm. It seemed odd because several customers had full, untouched drinks in front of them and really why would a hotel bar that was still busy close at 11:30pm on a Saturday night? Not a huge deal but I wish we'd known they closed that early because we probably would have either stayed out or tried to get back earlier. Location was great, easy walking distance to lots of places (even in the freezing cold!)I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to try out more of their locations!",30-Jan-19,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
888,"I had always heard that Aloft hotels had great design and were very nice, so I decided to finally stay in one. The lobby and front desk staff were nice and my room's decor wasn't that exciting, but nice.I arrived at night and was pretty tired, so I started unpacking my items and I noticed that all of the shelves were really dusty. It had to have been weeks or months since they last dusted (see pictures). I was a little grossed out, but I wiped off one of the shelves with a towel and put my folded clothes there. On one of the shelves that I wasn't using, I wrote ""Wash me"" with my finger in the dust, so that attention would be brought to the housekeeper when he or she came in the next day.I then went to take my shower and I noticed there were multiple hairs stuck to the shower wall. I had never been in the shower, yet, so they were clearly not mine. I was really grossed out by this point, but now it was really late, all of my items were put away, and I was naked, so I just dealt with it.There was also some kind of shiny substance stuck to the floor in the room, which I also have pictured.Outside of physical dirt, the room was ok, but the door to the bathroom was really hard to open and close. The next day, I was gone all day at work and when I got back, I realized that the housekeeper had come, but hadn't bothered removing the hair that was stuck to the shower wall or wiped down the dusty shelves even after I left her the note in the dust. At this point, I figured I just wanted a room with a different housekeeper, so I went to the front desk and showed them my pictures and they apologized and said the housekeepers were gone for the day, so my room couldn't be cleaned. I asked for a new room and they said ok, but I had to go get my items from the room first and come back down, which I did. I then had to talk to someone else and tell her everything over again, and she had a hard time reassigning me to a room.I was moved to a new room, which was cleaner, but the shelves were still a bit dusty and this one had a bathroom counter that didn't look fully wiped down as it had black hair-like things still left behind. I have a picture of that, too, but it's hard to see. The bathroom door in this room was also really hard to open and close.The next day, I went to work again and got back pretty late to find that my new room hadn't been cleaned at all. I checked my door to ensure I didn't have a do not disturb sign up and there was none, so I went back to the front desk again to let them know. Again, they said there were no housekeepers still there, so my room could be cleaned the next day. This was a little ridiculous because 1) I was leaving the next morning and the housekeepers are always supposed to come the next day and 2) The reason I moved rooms in the first place was because of a dirty room. I expressed this to them and they told me they would bring me some towels. So, all in all, this was a pretty bad experience on the cleaning side. I do think more could have been done to make up for the dirt and the lack of cleaning, but nothing was offered outside of allowing me to change rooms after I suggested it.

The front desk has a variety of board and card games to check out. The pool table and the 2 sided fireplace in the lobby made it the place to be late at night.

891,I booked at the Aloft because my sister recommended this brand however this was my first and last stay in an Aloft. The room was not bad although the blind in the room was broken and would not lower. I arrived late so I slept with it open the first night then I took it down and rerolled it the next day. I feel like the staff should have noted that the blind would not roll but chose not to correct it. My real issue was with the check in staff. I held the room on a card but chose to use another card once I arrived at the hotel. I noticed on my second day that money was being held on both cards. I went to the desk and advised them of this and was assured that the funds would be released from the initial card and no more charges would be added to this card however when I left both of my cards were charged for my stay at the hotel and other miscellaneous charges. I complained to the staff and was told that it would be corrected and that I would also receive a small credit on my account since I chose not to eat the free breakfast that I was offered. I never saw any credit on my acct for my inconvenience and it actually looked like I was charged a fee instead of a credit. I called after a few days to follow up but could not get it resolved and gave up on the issue. I don't know if this is normal for this but I was very disappointed in the customer service at this hotel. It may be that he hotel had just opened however I spoke with someone representing themselves as the manager when I went to the desk about the charges.,14-Jan-19,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
892,"My friend, who is an actor but also manages a retail store, told me how she trains her associates to consciously avoid RBF - resting b*tch face - so that customers feel welcome and comfortable. We have stayed at the Aloft Mag Mile twice now, and RBF is the default for the unfriendly, unempathetic, robotic front desk manager and staff. Maybe it’s a millennial thing to avoid eye contact, general pleasantries, problem-solving, saying hello? The hotel is a good value and has several positives as others have noted, but we won’t be returning due to the staff. They might as well train the robot that roams the lobby to do check-in and check-out via an iPad.",5-Jan-19,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
893,"Loved the idea of staying at a newer property and the price couldn't be beat. Great location, easy to walk just about anywhere. Bed was comfy, shower was large, appreciated the fridge in the room.Not ideal for more than 2 people. Bathroom door is loud and doesn't muffle any sound from inside, you can hear everything. Entry is dark so even if you wanted to use the mirror on the back of the door you couldn't because half your face was in shadows. No wastebasket other than the one in the bathroom-super inconvenient. Not very quiet. Could hear voices from the hall and other rooms. On one night the room next to us was blaring loud music and smoking pot. The whole hallway reeked and had to cram towels under the door an sleep with the window open just to breathe clean air. Security did come to their room multiple times and eventually the music stopped. Felt bad for the family with kids staying just a couple doors down. Super awkward walking into the lobby from outside-basically had to pass in front of whoever was performing. Lobby was loud and crowded-for us that was a negative, I know some people enjoyed all the activity.View from the room is an apartment/condo building across the street. Very little privacy unless you closed the blind which totally cut off all natural light. I'd give the hotel another chance if the rate was as good as the one we got but there are a number of other hotels available if you are willing to pay a little more.",2-Jan-19,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

898,"Recently stayed 16 nights at Aloft Mag Mile while in Chicago for business. It's a brand new Aloft, I believe the fourth generation regarding design. Love the brighter rooms vs. the dark gray found at other Aloft locations. Location is perfect, both for walking to downtown spots and if need to drive to metro areas (easy access to Lake Shore Drive). Great pool and fitness center on 19th floor...with views of the city.While the above details alone warrant a very positive review, it is the customer service that puts Aloft Mag Mile way over the top. Sixteen nights for a business trip can be brutal, but the staff made it the exact opposite experience. At every moment, they were incredibly personable, fun, warm, and caring. They truly made me feel at home. As I told Liz, the GM, ""You can teach anyone how to check guests in and out, but you can't teach personality and empathy."" These folks have it...and it made a my lodging experience emotional, not just transactional. Kudos to Aloft management for allowing each of the staff members to incorporate their unique personalities into their jobs vs. hotels where staff are robotic.I am a Marriott Platinum Premier Elite customer, but it was wonderful to see non-elites get the same level of care and service. And yes, they were also wonderful with a few Platinum members who were less than polite (those Platinums with entitled attitudes, aren't kind, complain about even the smallest things, AND give the rest of us Platinums a bad name).Big thanks to: Liz, Juliana, Everence, Juliane, Kevin, Madeline, Keneitha, Nina, Michael, and the valet parking gang!Keep doing what you are doing...thank you!",23-Dec-18,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html

Great offerings on TV. Nice pool. Friendly helpfull staff.Just a couple of shortcomings. The alarm clock went off at like 5:30 a.m. We didn't set it! The air in the room was very dry.

905,"Booked a room here while in town to visit family and friends. I’d always wondered if the loft style design would mean a cold, sterile feel. Well, it did not! My king-room on the 9th floor facing Ontario was perfectly cozy and comfortable. The floor plan was smart and I really appreciated the bench and table for eating or working. Another bonus was the wall-mounted shampoo/conditioner and shower gel inside the shower. The lobby is spacious with great conversation areas throughout. This time of year Chicago is magical and Aloft Mag Mile added to that festive feeling with its decor and friendly service. There was a potbelly next door along with epic burger, blaze pizza and a Lyfe Kitchen restaurant across the street and a Garrett’s Popcorn half way down the block. Wonderful location. Book here and you will not be disappointed. ",1-Dec-18,Aloft Chicago Mag Mile,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d14920104-Reviews-Aloft_Chicago_Mag_Mile-Chicago_Illinois.html
906,"Great value for this location, so close to everything. The lobby is fun to hang out at, with fireplace, pool table, games, a robot that cracks jokes or fetches orders, a small store, bar and great views. Restaurants just outside the door, steps to all the shops, lights and Magnificent Mile. Enjoyed the live music in the lobby every night at 7pm. There is a nice workout room on the 19th floor that my teens used a lot. There is also a nice, warm, brand new swimming pool on the same floor- with some nice city views. Our room had queen size beds, which are nice for my husband and son who are both well over six feet tall. Beds comfy. We turned off the climate control at night, because frankly it could be a little annoying to listen to - and the rooms were already fine without it. The room was really comfortable and my teens loved the urban decor and vibe. Free coffee in room, the toiletries were a nice touch and everything here has a little humor, creativity or unique touches. There aren’t a lot of extras, but you can grab free bottles of water at the workout room and the service downstairs at check in and checkout was caring and responsive.

It's literally a few footsteps away from the festival. It's also within walking distance of quite a few attractions (The Art Institute & The Bean, to name a few). The hotel itself a bit dated though; it could use some upgrades. One thing I did not like is the amount of homeless people allowed to hang around outside of the front door.

911,Stayed on the 14th floor in this very old historic building. Good-sized room but the bathroom needed some TLC. The shower was leaking (caulking coming out) and the shower itself very small (due to the age of the building). Not the best view but we weren't there for that. Room could use some art or some other colour - 90% white with a dark carpet. Don't think they used a designer. Lovely old elevators. Staff are all super friendly. Great bar with great bartenders.

Honestly, the good review is because it works to stay in, feels historic but is in the literal perfect location to walk to Millenium Park, CIBC theatre, Art Institute, boat tours, etc and is a cheap Lyft ride to other attractions.

For anyone thinking of using this hotel, I would suggest you read the negative reviews on tripadvisor very seriously. This is an extremely outdated hotel and none of the rooms even have A/C or heat. When I asked about heating my room, the front desk said that can bring me a plug-in heater or a plug-in fan. Isn't this 2019? What hotel brings you a plug-in heater?My room smelled like paint. In fact, it appears they have re-painted the room over-and-over-and-over again where there must be like 50 layers of paint. They also painted over all the outlets, so in order to plug in your phone/computer, you have to unplug all your lamps OR charge everything in your bathroom.NO hot water. This was by far my biggest complaint. I asked to change rooms as 5-days of no hot water is no bueno. They did nothing. I complained several times. They did nothing.I talked to the manager, Ms. Francine, several times, and she was unprofessional and downright rude to me claiming this is an old hotel and lots of people complain about it. When I called to have someone come up to help me find outlets in my room that worked, nobody ever came (even after I called the front desk 4-times over a 3-hour period).I've never felt this way about a hotel.

The hotel was overrun with scantily clad men who occupied all public areas and the entrance areas so that each time we entered or exited we did so through plumes of cigarette smoke and had to push our way through the throng.Each time we caught the lift it was slow to arrive and usually full, so we either squeezed in with the half naked bodies or waited for an empty lift which took some time.On our last day, after checkout, we were forced to go to the nearby genteel Hilton Hotel to relax before our flight as there were no areas available in the Congress Plaza. I consider myself broadminded but the fact that there were no public areas for people not involved in the Leather Convention to relax was a huge oversight on the part of the Hotel.My concern is that this convention was not publicised sufficiently on the online booking sights.",1-Jun-19,The Congress Plaza Hotel & Convention Center,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d87595-Reviews-The_Congress_Plaza_Hotel_Convention_Center-Chicago_Illinois.html

934," Once you leave the first floor of this facility you will feel as though you entered into a bad haunted house or theme park horror ride. The place is decaying around the guests. Our first assigned room was on the 12th floor of the South Tower. The hall was shadowy, the doors on most rooms were a mishmash of different styles with various obvious damage. The ""lock"" on the room was a deadbolt with only one half of the lock in place, severe damage and a door handle that was about to come off in one's hand. The entry light was a flickering flourescent that would not stop buzzing. The bathroom was tiny and you had to step up to get into it. The windows were dinky and placed oddly on the walls. We were moved to the North Tower which is in slightly better rough repair but everywhere there is gouging of wood, badly painted trim and sleazy carpeting. And there was no heat. Apparently the management decided the cool weather was over and the central air unit in each room could only blow outside air in. They did send up a small ""space heater"" which quit working 3 minutes after it started. The ""furniture"" is a poor version of IKEA products.

938,"I booked 28 nights (total more than $6000) at The Congress Plaza Hotel for our Company Sales Team to attend a major convention at McCormick Place. Seven total rooms, some more nights than others. We even shared rooms with some team members to save $. Reasons for booking here was to save about $3000 from staying at the show site, proximity to entertainment downtown and close dining options. I’d say view since they advertised it, but they placed us in rooms facing another hotel. There was no view.Our reservations were all confirmed through Expedia. They were all confirmed when I checked in day one, but with a long time taken at the desk to sort out the reservations for many staff coming and going at different dates. Still, all seemed well. I left a Master schedule for all our rooms and guests, by names, at the front desk. The rooms were all over the hotel, not in one area for staff activity conveniences. Everyone had a different style room. Only ONE of our 10 guests had a room that was acceptable. The rest were unclean, doors were not properly secured, windows barely opened (be aware -- you do not control the temperature in your own room). The hotel either has heat on or AC on for ALL rooms, regardless of room preference, and the default temp for all rooms was ""set"" at 74 degrees. Outside it was 75-80 degrees most of the week. AC was NOT available during our stay.We were asked to check out and check back in each of our 7 days there, or else we would be locked out, despite never having to change rooms. This was due to the way Expedia booked the rooms vs. the way the hotel booked the same set of rooms. They could not figure it out. This confusion resulted in our room keys malfunctioning EVERY DAY. We all had to return to the front desk on multiple occasions after having gone up 10-12 floors to our rooms. The front desk told us our cards were being de-magnetized at the show. Not true. It was their reservations challenges. Had I NOT confirmed available rooms left for later arriving guests EACH DAY, those guests would not have had a room, despite our confirmations day one (and again day two) at the hotel. Keep in mind, all our rooms were PREPAID in FULL. The showers leaked onto the bathroom floors, soaking up floor mats each time we showered. One room had a doorknob connecting the adjacent connected room that had been loosened by the other room to where there was a 1” gap to see into our room! The last straw was when our President received a call at 11:30 p.m. one night from the front desk, awakening him, asking him why he was still in that room. He was furious. He still had two more nights on his PREPAID room. His key worked, so obviously they had him in there, but their crappy reservation/scheduling systems did not reflect his complete stay. Still, why would ANY hotel call a room so late at night with such a ridiculous question? Answer: None would. Except for the Congress Plaza.Everyone but one guest had a HORRIBLE experience at this hotel. After complaining for the sixth day in a row, the Hotel Manager, Shaquille, told me our beef was with Expedia since they were paid in full by us but paid the hotel only 80% - as was their agreement with Expedia - so he had nothing left to refund us for our inconveniences. There is plenty more that was inconceivable about our stay here. SO UNPROFESSIONAL. We should have checked out day one and gone to another hotel, one where the rest of the hotel was as nice as the lobby. Very misleading! Bottom line?

943,"The reviews here had me nervous. I was paranoid about cleanliness, rude staff and a rundown location. Perhaps it is because reviewers lowered my expectations that I was so pleased by what we found.The vallet was welcoming and friendly right out of the gate. The bellhop was courteous and quick. Check in was smooth. The room was HUGE! 10 foot ceilings, nice sized and clean beds, a spacious bathroom, amazing toiletry items, a Keurig in the room, a fridge that actually gets cold, and the fan does blow air. The hotel is OVER 100 YEARS OLD. If I came in to find a modern establishment inside of the historical facade I would have been disappointed. What you have are layers of time that you can see. We have enjoyed seeing the charming differences from the closets, to the bathroom tiles to the way the plugs are laid out in the room. You are getting a time capsule experience here. You can feel the turn of the 20th century and the essence of the 1950s. If you do not enjoy quirks and living history then this is not for you, stay at a Hilton.

947,"This hotel is dated. Some of the dated details add a lovely charm to the hotel but others do not simply because they were neglected. Attention to detail in our room was lacking. The caulking around the tub was very sloppy, there was a home made plywood counter top, sloppy paint, and just poor workmanship. These things take away from the hotel greatly. Just because a space is old doesn't mean it should be treated so poorly. I really think if the maintenance of the hotel paid better attention to detail it wouldn't matter that it wasn't 100% remodeled. The biggest down side though was the fact that we couldn't control the temperature in our room! There was a fan and we could adjust the speed but not the temperature. Nothing is worse than not getting a good night's sleep because your too hot, ugh! The location of the hotel was perfect for us to celebrate St. Patrick's day.

After a call is placed downstairs and a rude conversation Is had with a member of the staff, I'm told the manager will come see me with keys to a better room. A bellhop shows up 10 minutes later with keys to a new room, no manager. Not only does he take at look at our concerns and non nonchalantly respond, he doesnt even walk us to our new room. Definitely a 2 star hotel at best. Just because you've been around since the 1890's does not mean you have class. The place looks like it's been renovated by some college kids.

This was a problem regardless of where I was in the hotel...I wonder if all three hotels are trying to share a single internet access and the bandwidth is just spread too thin across all of the guests.

The hotel lost one of the room reservations even though all rooms were booked for the same amount of nights under the same reservation confirmation number. I also filled out a credit card pre-authorization form prior to their arrival through the hotel's secure online website. I was told they were unable to find that paperwork even though I'd received an email confirmation that the paperwork had been received by the hotel the day I completed it. The employee who did not have a room spent a few hours waiting to be given a room and was unable to get to the convention center on time to help with our booth set up. The front desk staff eventually gave the stranded person a room by creating a new reservation for her and I spent the next few hours on the phone with the front desk staff and the general manager asking how so much could go wrong with this reservation to which I was basically told that the employee has a room now so the issue had been fixed. No apologies for any inconvenience and when I asked for any type of compensation they said they could only offer me Hilton Honors points for the inconvenience. It's been a month and the points still haven't shown up in my account.I'm giving this hotel 2 stars for its proximity to the convention center and my employees said the rooms were nice.

1002,"My frustration may have been due to the hotel being newly opened. I’ve stayed at another hotel connected to the skyway that connects the hotels to the Wintrust Arena and convention center. First of all, I checked in on the phone. Then it notified me of the valet parking option. I can’t recall the amount, but it seemed really high! Knowing it is connected to the convention center, I parked and took an elevator to the walkway. I got to the walkway that connects to the hotel... And it was locked. They need to install a sensor to allow hotel guest to get back and forth. This was not an option, it was locked with a cable. Speaking of using the electronic key on your phone, I went to work out and after working out, I tried to get back on the HGi elevators, and the phone didn’t pick up the lock. It picked up the pool, laundry and workout center, not the elevator, so they NEED A PHONE outside the elevator to call the front desk. Fortunately I had the number to the hotel and had to call them that way, to have someone come and let me in. The breakfast offered in the morning is in a great location. The service was quick and the breakfast was cooked perfectly. Gratuity was actually included on an order for one, which I thought was odd. The room was nice too. Clean, and decent size for rooms near Chicago. Will I come back? Probably. But not for awhile, until all the issues: Parking, walkway, access to elevator, etc get fixed.

Desk lamp not working. Electric outlets inconveniently located. Problem #2y key card no longer worked. I found myself locked out on my second morning.

Trust and honesty are not too much to expect from a hotel and it's staff. When I stay at a hotel, I should feel safe and I should feel that my things are safe.

1044,"I review a number of hotels each year. I travel for business, and typically look for hotels close to the convention centers I vend at. I like a quiet room, in a safe neighborhood with good food options. I got none of that here. I had to wait to review this as I was extremely angry about my stay. We prepaid for this through a travel website and would not have been able to cancel and get our money refunded. This hotel is on the south side, and far from anything in the downtown area or convention center. It's small, extremely run down and poorly managed. The only bonus here is the view of the water outside and a small cafe next door. Check in was at the La Quinta Inn next door. Parking was limited and hard to find anytime after 4 pm. We were given a room on the second floor. Upon inspection the outer security door wouldn't close, and the room itself had a bad smoking smell and a busted door lock into the room. We asked for another room, and were assigned another room in the same hallway. We had to request yet another room, citing security concerns. We were finally given a room in another hallway, up a flight of steep stairs. The security chain was broken, but the outer door security worked. The stairs were very steep, wobbly and had threadbare and torn up carpet. The room was in extreme disrepair- I have shown pictures below of some of the issues. After the first night we realized some of the occupants must be living there- constantly slamming and going in and out dozens of times a night. There were six rooms in the hallway. It was a ridiculous amount of traffic and noise. Saturday night when we returned to the rooms our keys had all been deactivated. No apology. They reissued new ones. All four keys, for the security door and our rooms. It wasn't a matter of where they were kept. It seems they thought that we had checked out. Even with our things still in the room and our room paid for. Staff couldn't really care or be bothered by anything during our stay here. The hotel needs serious work, and safety updates. There was a homeless man living in the green space out in front. Not only will I not stay here again, I'm appalled they were even charging what they did. Positives- it's right on Lake Shore Drive. The toilet had good flushing pressure. I can't think of anything else. At all.

1045,"I had to stay in this hotel for 6 nights in September. It is a place with some drawbacks but basically there is not much around Hyde Park so thanks god it exists! The place is called a hotel but it looks like a motel with its two story construction. Although it is by Lakeshore Drive because it is oriented perpendicular to the lake you do not hear much of the traffic noise. The location is close to the bus #6 and the metra station or university shuttles. Although this area of Hyde Park seems to be safer it is still a little scary to walk around alone at night. The rooms are standard, clean and not too small. The house keeping was great. I only wish they would provide a comforter or thicker blankets. I had only one concern during my stay in this place and it was the non-existing windows. There are windows—one piece of glass— but you can not open them. The air circulation is only provided by the air conditioner which is not healthy! I hope they can improve the situation in the near future. I should also mention that the reception does not look like a reception and it is not in the same building.

1054,"Don't plan to sleep late, there is massive construction going on...something that was not on the Orbitz site. There was bang, hammer, loud voices, drilling, swearing, many other languages spoken at 7 something in the Morning. Meghan was so helpful. Hope I am spelling her name correctly. There were a few things I needed help with, like getting a remote control for one. She was kind, professional, empathetic, and did whatever it took to get the job done. The housekeeping staff came into my room when the teeny-tiny sign was hung for do not disturb and placed a remote in the room; hours after I had requested one. I took the extra remote back to the office on Thursday, July 9. The staff personage then, was cold, lacked empathy, remote and had a distinct attitude of being miffed. They wanted me to recount the entire story. When I mentioned Meghan's name there was a snort of sort. I say to them, you could learn a lot from Meghan in the handling of people. One told me she was studying to be a nurse( it in difficult for me to move around, I have MD); I hope she treats her patients, when she gets to that point with a true empathy and understanding, and not with borderline disdain. Maybe Meghan can give them lessons. There are no true hallways and really no place for other people to hang out, so I definitely didn't see any drug traffic, none. It would be nice if they standardized the DO NOT DISTURB signs, making them visible for everybody. The 5 stars for service is for Meghan, other than that I would have given them 1.

1057,"We arrived in Chicago on June 12 for a two-night stay at the Chicago Lakeshore Hotel after making reservations in early January. Far from being placed in “a spacious guest room” with “breathtaking views overlooking magnificent Lake Michigan,” as the hotel misleadingly claims on its website, we were housed in a fetid, musty room on the ground floor of a building that was under construction. Ants crawled on the wall and the walkway was so flooded that it seemed like Lake Michigan was lapping at our door. We had reserved a double bed, smoke free room and, in an unsavory bait and switch tactic, we were offered a smoke-filled, ground floor room, with a king size bed. The hotel worker made no mention of this downgrade, clearly hoping that it would go unnoticed or that we would not challenge it. When we protested, we were simply placed in another ground floor room which, except for the smell of smoke, was equally malodorous. As all the hotels near the University of Chicago were fully booked because of the university’s graduation ceremony on June 13, we had no choice but to stay at what is, at best, a shockingly run-down motel.If you want to enjoy your stay in Chicago, stay clear of the Chicago Lakeshore Hotel!",18-Jun-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
1058,"When I pulled up to this hotel, I was horrified to find it under a matrix of scaffolding. When I made reservations at the hotel, nowhere had it been mentioned that the hotel was under construction (being converted to a La Quinta). This would be fine if it resulted in a discounted price, but it didn't. They still charged me full price.So, where to start with my problems with this place? It might be easier if I just listed them off:- As we were in Chicago for a reunion, our family had reserved 5 separate rooms several months before. For some reason, they were unable to give us our rooms a convenient distance from each other. Instead we were scattered in different sections of the hotel.- The water in one of these rooms ran brown, with sediments. After running it for a while, it still didn't run clear. So, we had to buy bottled water for our rooms. The hotel didn't even provide these for us. We had to go to a grocery store a mile away and buy them ourselves.- There was a major puddle outside the door of one of our rooms. What did the hotel do to help us get ourselves and our things past the puddle and into our rooms? Laid down three pieces of plywood, which we were expected to hop from one to another until we were across the puddle. Like a frog hopping across lily pads on a pond.- The drain of both the sink and the tub in one of our rooms weren't functioning, so bother had standing water in the sink for a day.- The renovations being done left exposed, unshaded lights right outside our windows, which shined into our rooms all night.- Some of the staff was tremendously unhelpful and impolite. When I asked how long it would take to get to O'Hare airport, I was told that it would take me 2 hours! When I checked on Google Maps, and it told me 40 minutes, this staff member rolled her eyes at me and told me to ""believe who I want"".Hands down the worst hotel experience I've ever had.

Friday after our arrival we went into the hotel bar to enjoy a drink. Upon arriving we found there was a reunion in the bar area and seating was limited. We asked if sitting in the restaurant was an option; not if we were unwilling to purchase the seafood buffet (some members of the party have shellfish allergies). We headed into the bar for the last two available tables; they were in front of an audio system (aka boombox) with the volume turned up. When we moved the tables out of the way of the speakers, the server moved them back. We asked if the music could be turned down, we were told no and were informed the music would become even louder as the evening progressed. The hotel bar is poorly run; they had run out of Bud Lite on tap and had a limited supply of bottles. Their beer selection is pitiful to begin with!The accommodations:Party #1 was given a room on the 1st floor in the historic wing of the hotel. The door did not have a dead bolt and no outdoor lighting by their door.Party #2 and 3 were given rooms on the 3rd floor. A tray of dirty dishes in the hallway greeted them upon their arrival and remained there for the duration of their stay Their rooms had not been totally renovated.Party #4 was given a room on the 4th floor; they came back from a long day of sightseeing to hundreds of gnats in their room.On a positive note the hotel shuttle had a flexible schedule and a delightful driver.",17-Jun-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

The lobby is a mess and virtually unusable, and there is plastic tarp over the windows to the rooms with the views being obstructed by scaffolding. Luckily the rooms themselves are perfectly fine. It's a strange setup, with many of the rooms being in a separate building adjacent to the main. At night the parking lot and room entrances are very poorly lit, but the neighborhood is Hyde Park, which is a good one, but certainly not perfect. No issues with hot water, plumbing or maid service. If you're not familiar with Chicago, Hyde Park is quite south of the city center. If you don't have a car you can easily take the Metra (4 blocks from the hotel) to Millennium Park where you can have access to all the major buses and trains.

I was wrong.. the pictures of the rooms are def. out of date. This hotel is poorly designed..and the walls are soooo thin... First 2 nights in our room we had girls yelling and banging on doors waking us up... the 3rd night there was a group of men staying in the 3 rooms next to ours and they were obviously there to party... being that it was our 3rd night and did not want to have loud noise again we called security, the security thankfully took care of it... but it was irritating that we had already had 3 nights of loud noises from our neighbors, the last night we didn't even want to stay there anymore... we checked out in the middle of the night and slept at the airport because we just couldn't stand it anymore.... The Ants are a problem, we killed a bunch on walls and the floors, my friend got bit by a few on her stomach while sleeping.. The water pressure sucks in the shower, the light in the bathroom was out when we checked in, they came to change it, it worked for 1 night then went out again the next day, we didn't bother calling them to change it again. The plastic wrap on all the windows make you feel claustrophobic, cause you can't even look outside... Maybe things will be better after the renovations, but they honestly shouldn't be renting out rooms with the extensive amount of construction there doing.. or given way more discount to stay there.... check yelp for more accurate reviews...",24-May-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
1062,"Hotel under maintainance-reception desk provisional in a small and fullpacked room. Never have seen a Hotel in such bad conditions. They should be Closed during maintaince. Even 1 Dollar per night were too much. Stayed 2 hours and left on the same day. Neighbourhood looks scary.Managment ok, refund my booking totally.

1063,"This property is in full-blown construction mode. The day we arrived, they had just transferred the reception desk from an old hotel room to the ""new"" lobby. The new lobby furniture was still covered in drop cloths. Parts of the exterior of the hotel are covered in scaffolding. The free parking that is advertised was very limited since the garage was occupied by construction vehicles and equipment and not accessible to guests. We were not able to find an actual space to park after returning to the hotel in the early afternoon and the staff was not very helpful in suggesting alternatives. The available rooms and hallways are nicely renovated. However, for the rate we were charged, I would not have expected bath towels that I could literally see through, no holder for the toilet paper, sketchy wi-fi, and a flat screen television without HD picture.I definitely do not feel the accommodations were worth the price that we paid. Perhaps when the renovations are completed it will be a better value.",18-May-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
1064,"My wife had a week long training in downtown so we needed a hotel that was close but not too expensive. The rates were surprisingly low for the area so we weren't expecting anything too nice. The neighborhood where the hotel seems like a great area. More like a village type environment. When we arrived, the hotel was/is in TOTAL disarray due to the renovations. The walk to the elevator will make you a bit uneasy at 1st...until you step off of the elevator to head to your room. My goodness, the rooms are in excellent shape and the housekeepers do an amazing job. As a matter of fact all the staff were awesome (Lidia is THE BEST).

1065,I stayed here for a conference that was held downtown. The shuttle to Central Loop was a very nice feature of the hotel (otherwise it is a $15 cab ride to downtown). The staff and hotel owner very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable.,19-Apr-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
1066,"TL/DR: Reception poor and disorganized, hotel in very poor condition (being renovated), location not convenient to public transportation. Would advise spending a bit more money and staying somewhere in the loop and taking Metra, CTA or cab (<15$) to get to Hyde Park. Rooms, however, seemed clean if you don't care about the rest.I'm a pretty low brow reviewer, check my other hotel reviews for reference... The hotel is in a fairly convenient location to Hyde Park/University of Chicago but not close to any public transportation, and not really convenient walking distance to UChicago. The hotel is under construction right now; it looks like it may have been acquired by La Quinta and is being brought up to their ""style"" and ""standards,"" but for now, the hotel is in shambles. Construction is continually taking place outside the guest room windows (construction workers working right out side the windows at 7-8AM on weekends). The newer building looks like it would be nice, but we weren't able to get a room in there. Instead, we were given a room in the old building which reeked of cigarettes. The hotel was kind enough to give us a new room that didn't smell (as badly) after some grumbling. Reception was hard to find (and in a re-purposed guest room while the lobby is under construction). When we arrived for the 9 AM check-in that we requested, we had to (literally) climb over garbage on the floor to get to the ""reception"" room. Reception was filthy and a cleaning person was literally scrubbing a toilet in the attached bathroom while we were trying to check in. We were told (after filling out a form to request 9 AM check-in) that we could not get early check-in and would have to return at 3 to get our room. I understand not having early check-in, but it was requested before arrival, so we'd have appreciated being told it wasn't possible before we planned around it. At 11 AM the same day we got a text denying our early check-in request... Would've been nice the day before. At any rate, the room we eventually got was very old, but seemed clean. We considered finding a new hotel, but figured we'd already sunk the money in on a pre-paid room, so we learned our lesson. Once the hotel is no longer under construction, location will still not be convenient, but the other complaints likely won't hold.",14-Apr-15,Chicago Lake Shore Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90922-Reviews-Chicago_Lake_Shore_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html
1067,"We stayed in this hotel because it was conveniently located in the Hyde Park neighborhood AND on the lakeshore. The hotel was currently under construction, so our hallway was a bit of a disappointment, but the rooms were nice and clean. One floor was already completed, though, and it looked BEAUTIFUL! Parking was free in a covered lot. Both the L train and the #6 bus are two blocks down, and you can take them straight downtown. The room had a nice-sized tv, a coffee maker, and comfortable beds. Close to a couple of cafés.If we come back to Chicago, we'd stay here again.

1071,"I recently stayed at the Sophy hotel in Hyde park when I visited my daughter who is studying at UChicago. She had told me about this new hotel that had opened, coincidentally her name in Sophia! I have stayed in many excellent hotels around the world and I have to say that Sophy compared to many of them. I think the thing that impressed me the most was the intelligent, thoughtful and tasteful design. There were little touches such as the positioning of the shower control in the large walk-in shower, the light switches, the coat hooks near the door that were part of the design. The literary decor gave the room character. It is contemporary but not stark. Tasteful. My room was spacious and very comfortable. It was the weekend and the hotel was humming with guests and activity. It is a small boutique hotel so there isn't an army of staff which is nice. Everyone that helped me was fantastic. I certainly look forward to staying there again and again. ",9-Jul-19,Sophy Hyde Park,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d13927661-Reviews-Sophy_Hyde_Park-Chicago_Illinois.html

1073,"In brief, the Sophy in Hyde Park is a hotel I would recommend for the beautiful decor and design of the hotel and the rooms.

1078,"Great hotel overall, but very overpriced. The staff are super nice. Coffee in the lobby was excellent. The room was excellent (e.g., spacious, comfortable, good shower, large bathroom, good furniture). A few things that surprised me: very noisy A/C -- I'd only have it on when not in the room + no breakfast included + 45-dollar parking (which I can sort of see for that neighborhood in Chicago, but still --- I found street in Nichols park / a 5-min walk). The bed was too soft for my taste (but tastes differ). Bottom line: the conference paid for my trip but otherwise I doubt I'd be willing to pay over 200 per night. All the good features, including the vinyl player, are really not worth it.

1079,"I have to say this was one of my best hotel experiences in a very long time. I came to Chicago for a conference at McCormick Place. Typically, I have stayed downtown for this conference, however this time I thought I would try something different. The first thing that you notice is that you are in a thriving neighborhood full of activity, not tourist active though but real life and it is close to Lake Michigan. The hotel is situated in the heart of Hyde Park. On the outside the building is attractive, contextual with both a restaurant entrance and main hotel entrance. Upon entry you are in a comfortable, cool, modern environment with great Jazz music playing over the sound system. The staff on check in was outstanding - professional, kind and friendly. Of note, I arrived much earlier that I was planning and they were able to accommodate an early check in, which was much appreciated. The hotel is new (September 2018), clean and crisp (all good things). The room is spacious with every detail paid attention to - outlets where you need them, extremely comfortable beds and pillows, the control valve in the shower is right in front of you when you enter instead of below the shower head, large windows, great furnishings and a well stocked mini-bar. One of my favorite things was the steamer for my clothes...it was the first time that I used one and I am sold...so much easier than ironing (for those of you who want an iron they have them on request). I used both Uber and the Metra Rail (which is a 5 minute walk away and takes you directly into McCormick place very affordably). I stopped into Hyde Park Records which had an amazing collection of soul, R&B, Jazz and Blues. It was fun spend a bit of time and browse what they had in the store. For breakfast I went to Valois Restaurant just down the street, great breakfast, nice people and great service - very affordable too. I have to say the thing I like most about the hotel was it’s overall vibe...hip and cool and comfortable for all. I also liked the music...I can’t say enough good things about my experience on this trip...Thank you Sophy Hyde Park!",29-Jun-19,Sophy Hyde Park,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d13927661-Reviews-Sophy_Hyde_Park-Chicago_Illinois.html

Everyone was very friendly and professional. After settling in the room, we made our way down to the hotel bar to grab some drinks and a snack before we had dinner in the city. Working in a hotel bar, I knew what to expect and I was not disappointed. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and the service was great!

I’m not sure about the weekend hours.On Thursday night I decided to have dinner at the restaurant around 7PM without a reservation, not a good thing to do, 1 hour wait which I didn’t wait. I was told to seat at the bar area . It took more 17 minutes for someone to show up, clean my table and bring me the menu. Because I had waited so long I ask the person to take my order and was informed that he couldn’t because he was not a waiter. I waited another 10 minutes and no one approached my table, I literally just stood up and left. That was the only downside of this beautiful property in Hyde Park.I will definitely come back and I hope to have a chance to try the restaurant.I noticed that every evening the bar and restaurant are pretty crowded; needs attention on service.",13-Jun-19,Sophy Hyde Park,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d13927661-Reviews-Sophy_Hyde_Park-Chicago_Illinois.html
1091,"At 2 am I wake up because I sense that something is wrong and sure enough, there is no power in the room. I stumble to find my way to the house phone and dial 0, I tell whoever answered that there is no power in the room and they say oh yeah the power went out in the whole building. I say, well what's going to happen next? They answer that the engineers are working on it. I asked about how long, they don't know and they ask if there is something I need. I answer that we are hot and they recommend that we open the windows. Needless to say that open windows did not help the heat situation. Neither one of us could sleep during the power outage and afterwards we could not fall asleep again. About an hour and a half later, the power came back on. I wanted to check out right then and there but my husband convinced me that it was better to wait until daylight to check out. I was so upset! I wanted to sleep!!!When we check out the next morning, I inquiry about what was the issue last night with the power outage and the person at the front desk is clueless as to what I am talking about. Her excuse was that she just got in and has no idea of what happened last night. You mean to tell me that such an even as an entire building power outage does not get reported to the next shift? I don't believe that for a minute. How about a generator in cases like this? Everything had gone extremely well until the power outage and then when the clerk at the front office tells us that she has no clue what happened, I just thought that was unbelievable. When a shift leaves it's supposed to report to the coming shift anything that is worth mentioning - I think a power outage would be considered a worthy notification for the next shift.

1106,"This boutique hotel is elite. the quality of the buildout is top shelf. The F&B is great, and the vibe is cool.

1107,"The Sophy is one of the best hotels I've stayed at. I travel with moderate frequency (approximately 14 work trips and 4 personal each year) and stay at a fair share of mostly 4-star hotels. What I love most about the Sophy is the architectural detail in both the common areas (lobby, lounge separating hotel from restaurant, restaurant lounge and seating area) and the rooms. In both, the flow from one space to another is seamless, yet the separations among them are clear. Additionally, I love the local character and warmth that is achieved by the thoughtfulness and attention to detail in the finishes. Dark warm wood, marble, wood floors, and especially the choice to appoint the rooms (and common areas) with the work of local artists, local authors, and quite possibly goods from local vendors (e.g., real vinyl records possibly from Hyde Park Records on the next block). It really was like being in a home away from home. And in the heart of Hyde Park on the main strip, just steps away from a great variety of food choices.

The room was pleasant, with some odd items, like a magnifying glass and some old records and record player. Very nice walk in shower. No bathtub. Coffee in the room is Maxwell House and you make it yourself with a filter and using an electric kettle for heating the water. There was no decaf.

We paid a little extra and got the suite which was spacious. The AC was a little loud but outside everything was great. Our room on the 4th floor didn’t seem to have a lot of street noise but maybe the AC masked it.

We stayed in a King room which was the smallest hotel room I’ve ever been in, including NYC. The street noise was terrible, hallway noise was terrible, we could hardly run the air conditioner while sleeping because it was so loud, and we could hear any time a neighboring room turned on the water. The room didn’t have a fridge or microwave. There is on-site parking, both a surface lot and underground. Underground clearance is so low that we scraped the top of our Jeep on the pipes. Major bummer at this hotel as it is in a great location. Also, the Cubs lost.

Some excuse about booking. We received no email, text or phone contact concerning the reservation. We had to do the work ourselves to confirm things. Because of the delay at check-in, we missed our scheduled dinner reservations at our favorite dinner spot and we were just let down by the whole thing.

1146,"My 3 star rating is not a negative mark on the hotel; it is just to indicate that it is objectively a solid, no-frills 3 star hotel. What I mean by that, is that the lobby is very tight and overall the hotel (exterior, hallways, elevator, etc) is very dated and not pristine /luxurious like you would see in a 4 or 5 star hotel.I will say, that the staff was friendly, the room was clean, and the bed was pretty comfortable. That is about all you can ask for. It is also in the heart of River North so you have plenty of wonderful options for dining and entertainment. You are also only a few blocks from the Merchandise Mart CTA stop.My only minor knock (if I'm being picky) is that the elevators were pretty slow during peak times and very small (so only a few people can fit in with luggage). On top of that, the lobby area is so small that it can get really crowded waiting to get up to your room with your luggage. Also, the ""fitness center"" was literally one treadmill and some free-weights. As mentioned, the interior is also pretty dated.However, this hotel is a lot less than the 4/5 stars and it is solid (gets the job done).

The hotel hallway's smell with bring back memories of the '80s. But once you get past these ominous signs, the actual hotel room is charming.

1160,"We spent two nights here as it was one of the cheapest hotels in downtown Chicago that was also of decent quality. Rainforest cafè is right across the road and well worth a visit, a McDonald's is right next door too. Pretty much anything is within walking distance. We walked to the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier and the blue line that took us to O'hare.There is a small parking lot connected to the hotel and we had a rental car with us at arrival that we were allowed to park there while we checked in and offloaded our suitcases. We then returned the car to Budget car rental half a mile away.At check-in they quickly provided us with the baby crib we asked for (some hotels spend a long time getting this delivered to the room) and they also asked if we wanted a fridge and/or microwave in the room, free of charge. We said yes to the fridge and it was in the room by the time we got there.They asked for a deposit of $50 per night so we had to pay a $100 deposit for our two nights. At check-out they said this would go back as soon as she pressed the button, but at the time of writing, three days after check-out, I still haven't got these $100 back. A little bit annoying to have to keep checking the bank account for this as I don't completely trust hotels with something like this.",3-May-19,Best Western River North Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d114604-Reviews-Best_Western_River_North_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html

There is free tea, coffee, hot choc available in the guest services area beside reception till 9 pm. Also you have an adjoining restaurant/bar, well priced too.The location is spot on, 5 min walk to Grand station (Red line). 10 min walk to Merchant Mart station (Brown line).

It is very rare to find employees like him who are passionate about their job. I can tell that he loves helping people and he takes pride in the hotel.

1185,"I booked two rooms at the Hilton through our Chase Sapphire Preferred travel points. We travel with our two children so I called a week ahead of our trip to request adjoining rooms if possible, and next door to each other if they didn't connect. I spoke to a gentleman named Jamal who let me know the type of rooms we reserved did not connect, but he assured me that he would switch my reservation to a room type that did connect, at the same rate. He even emailed me a new room confirmation.When we checked in, we were given two rooms on different floors(!). When I explained that I had called and been assured that my reservation was switched to rooms that connect, they told me that my room types did NOT connect, and that they were oversold and therefore couldn't even assure our rooms were next door to each other. They ended up putting our kids in a room down the hall from us on the same floor, which was not convenient. No one ever explained or apologized for the fact that I'd been assured connecting rooms. I don't know if it was a miscommunication on the original employee's part or whether our room type change never went through. As it was only a four-night stay, we opted to stay in the rooms that were separated by about 30 feet of hallway. Since we share luggage with our kids, getting dressed every day presented a challenge, with lots of running back and forth and digging for the correct room key.Had it not been for the room mishap I would have given this hotel a higher rating. It is clean and comfortable and spacious. The sitting area in each room is a nice respite. It's also very quiet, yet very conveniently located right next to all the shopping and restaurants on the Magnificent Mile.

1186,"I stayed at the Hilton Suites/Miracle Mile in downtown Chicago for two nights. When i walked in, the room was warm (kind of expected it), had a great view and was large with a king size bed. I knew my arrival date was the only time I would have to look around town, so I basically took my sports coat out of my luggage, hung it up in the closet, turned the AC down and left. I did not get back until about 10:00 PM and when I sat on the bed both the foot end and the head end folded up. That was how bad the bed was cratered. The room was still hot and I lowered the A/C to 63 degrees. It never cooled off during my stay. I looked for electrical outlets, because the power and USB outlets on my side of the bed were out. When I laid down it was horrible and I was fighting not to roll into the center of the bed. I got up and called the front desk asking if there was another room available that the bed was horrible, the AC did not work and the electricity was out. No other rooms. She did say she would send an electrician to look at the electrical issue. The electrician came quickly and showed me you have to move the mattress back. Doing so he messed up all the sheets and cover on the bed.My friend in another room had the ideal room. No issues. I told them it was a crime to charge as much as they did for that quality of a room.

1205,We stayed at the hotel in the end of the April for three days. I like the executive lounge which is convenient for us to get milk for the kid. Breakfast is simple but ok. Bad1 we booked a hotel room called exploring Chicago package or something. Basically it said the hotel would offer up to 50% discount to different sites including navy pier Ferris wheel. But we didn’t receive anything. Upon arrival the front desk had no idea about that. After brief checking they said it might be something sent to our email after reservation. But we didnt have anything even in the spam or trash. They told me they would send me another email about that. Nothing happened. Very disappointed. Not sure what is the point of that room package. It’s a bit more expensive than the same type room without any tour discount claimed. 2 the mattress. One of the bed mattress is kinda broke. One side is actually higher than the other. My husband mentioned with housekeeping. Guess he should have asked front desk. Yes men are just lazy for those. ,4-May-19,Hilton Chicago/Magnificent Mile Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90986-Reviews-Hilton_Chicago_Magnificent_Mile_Suites-Chicago_Illinois.html
1206,"Wife and I are both gold members. We also are Hilton Vacation club owners. Rooms were clean, we slept well. Great location! There is no full breakfast at this hotel only a continental breakfast no meat. If you want a sausage and bacon type breakfast you must eat at restaurant in lobby for breakfast it cost me $68 for 2 breakfast meals and 2 kid breakfast “expensive”. The breakfast was a bummer we love our free breakfast, it was disappointing the Hampton Inn offers a better breakfast than this AAA Diamond Award hotel.

1207,Nice hotel near Water Tower and John Hancock building. Easy access to Hertz rental car around corner at Westin. Starbucks is at the Hancock building. 20 minute walk to Millennium Park and the Bean. Southern Cut Restaurant is good. Better than usual “hotel” food. Like the suite style of the rooms.

1208,"You cannot beat the location of this place, though I would say it is a little more difficult to find healthy food options as most food places cater to the tourist industry - River north is where you will find Freshii, Pret and manger and more health conscious choices for biz people. Rooms were nice, decent decor, but the bathroom was a little worn, peeling paint, missing parts on toilet, sink that backed up and did not drain. We got a good deal on the room booking early trhough hotels.com, so I wouldn't want to complain too much. It was a good stay - but not perfect.

View of the lake from the 20th floor was great. This is a fantastic location in the heart of the Mag mile. The executive lounge for diamond members was very nice, excellent service there.

1216,"We had a four night stay in an executive lake view suite on the 25th floor. The room was clean but the decor was very neutral and in my opinion rather drab. However, it had all the amenities to be expected, eg. coffee machine, microwave, fridge, safe, bathrobes. It was disconcerting though that upon arriving in the room we found that the toilet had not been cleaned and when it was flushed it promptly overflowed over the floor until I lifted the cistern lid and managed to stop it (main reason for giving 4 out of 5 in this review). Housekeeping was sent up to deal with it and they arrived fairly promptly. Also there was something spilt in the fridge that had not been cleaned before the room was occupied again. Executive lounge is on the second floor, breakfast and evening snacks were adequate but not remarkable. Staff were excellent, professional and welcoming. We were given 2 bottles of water gratis as Hilton Honors gold members but no room upgrade was offered. There is a pool on the 30th floor but we didn't use it. We ate in the Southern Cut restaurant twice and were very satisfied with the food. The lifts (elevators) were very slow, consistently long waits, and one had dodgy doors that would open part way and close again a couple of times before it would start going up to requested floors. Location of the hotel is great near the lake, restaurants and other sightseeing attractions.",16-Apr-19,Hilton Chicago/Magnificent Mile Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d90986-Reviews-Hilton_Chicago_Magnificent_Mile_Suites-Chicago_Illinois.html

However, it is perfectly suitable for a family, as their suite has 2 beds and a sofabed, which is great. The location is fantastic, within walking distance of museums and restaurants. The staff, from the valet on up, was very friendly and professional. We asked for a quiet room and got it. If you need a reasonably-priced, no-frills room to lay your head after a long day visiting Chicago sites, it's definitely adequate.

1264,"I was not stoked about staying at a Best Western, as I rather have stayed at the Hilton where our conference was taking place. However, the rooms at the Hilton sold out and this was the closest hotel to the conference. Over the phone, the staff seemed rather curt, and not really interested in helping us. However, once we arrived at the hotel, I was more than impressed with the friendliness of all the staff and the cleanliness of the common areas, and our rooms. Once our limo arrived at the hotel, the doormen immediately gathered a cart to help us unload. He was there every morning with a smile on his face ready to greet us. The front desk staff was friendly and did not hesitate to answer our questions. We found ourselves sharing an elevator with management and they were so helpful and eager to share tips on Chicago with us. Housekeeping always had our room nice and tidy by the time we returned. I honestly felt like I was staying at the HIlton without paying the cost. Do they have the most updated furnishings in the rooms? No, but the bed was extremely comfortable and everything was clean and smelled great. I rather have furniture that is a year or two old with excellent customer service, than the latest furnishings and rude employees. I will stay at this hotel over and over again. The attached restaurant was also quite a surprise. We spent a lot of money visiting the top restaurants around the hotel, and the hotel restaurant was were we ate the best food.

The heating unit wasn't regulated, so to control the temp we had to turn off and on. No refrigerator in room. The window were very poor and actually froze over with ice on the inside. And the windows had a lever to open them. We were on the 9th floor. Scary when traveling with kids. We wouldn't stay here again with kids. Staff was very nice.

1267,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. I did a lot of research and read many reviews before selecting this hotel so I knew what to expect. I requested to be away from the elevator, to have a refrigerator and to be on the highest floor as possible facing the lake. They came through with all my requests as well as a microwave and corner room with an amazing view. The room was a good size with a large bathroom. The set up of the room also amade for a quieter experience than I have had in others. We stayed 5 days and received lots of towels, pillows and extra blanket when needed from a very pleasant staff. The only thing missing was counter space in the bathroom but I knew that in advance so I wasn't surprised. The hotel was clean and actually smelled nice. It was close to many attractions where we could just walk and save a fare. We would definitely stay here again.

1269,"Staff was incredibly congenial as we checked in. They were in good spirits even as the property deals with pipe issues from the polar vortex the last couple weeks. This hotel has done all the updating possible without a major overhaul, given the age of the building. We were disappointed with the amount of road noise we experienced in our room on the top floor. We also had to put a towel along the bottom of the room door, as there was a pretty decent size gap between door and floor. Would definitely stay again. It’s a great price for the location.

You can see the wear and tear if you look for it. The rooms have little sound proofing as you can hear the outdoor noise no problem. Also, be prepared if you have neighbors on either side of your room you may hear every word they are saying. I would rank the hotel closer to a budget motel and not to the level of what I would see Best Western at. But you also have to consider you are in Chicago and the price for other hotels in the area from what I've seen was much higher.

We were able to see Lincoln park zoo which is free and an awesome zoo, Navy Pier, China town, and a Cubs game all by using the train. The orange line connects with all the other lines which makes it each to get around and the bus system was easy too. We felt safe the whole time we were there.

We originally booked the motel for price and proximity to Midway....but quickly came to love the Carlton Inn for people who work there and the services they provide The desk staff at the Carlton is genuinely friendly...energetic and engaged. If you check in before 6p you'll likely be lucky enough to be greeted by the three dog welcoming committe! The Carlton is a well maintained and charming place that is located a short ways (3 min drive) from Giordano's pizza...a Chicago classic.The rooms are comfy...the breakfast is delightful and there's a workout room!Shuttle service is provided free of charge and makes the trip to the airport short and sweet. Approx 10 min!Upon your return a quick call to the Carlton Inn and the driver is dispatched lickety-split to return you to your car at the motel. And here's where the added touches come in. We found 3 bottled waters waiting for us in our car along with chocolate chip cookies for each of us.I can't say enough about the Carlton Inn Midway experience!,5-Apr-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1304,"Although there was construction happening and the parking lot was ""tight"", this was a surprisingly comfortable hotel and we felt very safe. Staff were all friendly and accommodating. Super nice that upon your return, your car is brought to the front and warmed up! Reasonable price and worth it!",19-Mar-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1305,"This hotel is located just minutes from the Midway Airport, does not charge for parking, has a shuttle to the airport, helpful front desk people, and very nice newly renovated breakfast area. Many good restaurants located located in the area.

1306,"We stayed here before going to Costa Rica for 8 days. It was a nice place, and reasonable to stay and keep our cars while on vacay. They went out of their way and were accommodating to get our group of 8 to and from the airport on time. They also helped us find places that delivered food and offered their breakfast room to use for us all. The best part was, we came back to warm vehicles supplied with cookies and water for all after getting in from the airport at 1:00am. This really made all of us happy after a long day of travel! Would highly recommend for your travel needs!",10-Mar-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1307,"We travel several times a year and whenever we fly out of midway we stay here the night before. Steve at the front desk remembers us every time. We have always had friendly service no matter who is working. The rooms are basic but clean and quiet and the free hotel shuttle is always a bonus, taking us to dinner or shopping and of course to the airport. We park our car there for the same rate as many of the lots. When they pick us up and bring us back to the motel after our travel, the car is warmed up and there are cookies and bottled water in the car for us! Can't say enough about the service and the location is great.",22-Feb-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

1309,"Our flight was cancelled at the last minute and it was a late night after travelling all day so the helpfulness of front desk staff and fast shuttle pickup was very appreciated. I was a bit apprehensive when we got to the hotel because of the outside room entrances and all the fencing up due to remodeling / construction but upon entering lobby and being treated like a valued costumer put me at ease. Our luggage had been checked so we needed toiletries to get us thru the night and we were handed a box of odds and ends to take whatever we needed. What an added comfort! The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful. Both of our shuttle drivers were friendly and informative. The room was big, bed was a bit small for the 2 of us but it was a short stay. Water in shower was hot and since it was minus 12 degrees outside felt great. This is not a 5 star hotel but it is a great place to stay if you have a flight cancelled and need a room for a night or 2!",27-Jan-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

1311,"We were flying out of Midway Airport for Christmas holidays so chose Carlton Inn Midway for a second time! Since we were staying at the end of the trip, we checked in to drop off the car. The process was simple and the shuttle was there to drop us off at the airport. Our driver was so friendly and explained pickup. After getting our luggage around 10 on New Year's Eve, I called for shuttle. Less than 10 minutes the shuttle arrived for the 8 minute ride to the Carlton Inn!  Desk staff was very polite. Our room was furnished nicely and the bed was comfortable. The only negative was that the bathroom could use a big update. Breakfast was very good- nice variety & proper food temperatures. We will definitely stay here again as this is a good value for the money. If you re are used to luxury, this isn't for you. If you are looking for comfort, value & cleanliness this is the place!",3-Jan-19,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1312,Carlton Inn Midway staff greeted us & offered good suggestions on where to get a good Chicago Pizza[close by] & how to get the most out of our short stay in Chicago.They even drove us to the train station so we did not have to take our car downtown. The room was comfortable & had a refrigerator & microwave which allowed us to enjoy our pizza left overs.Breakfast is plentiful & many choices & the hot foods were hot!

1318,"So I was flying to CT for some family business and on my way to LAX I get a message from Southwest my flight from Midway Chicago to Bradley Hartford has been canceled (that is another story because come to find out planes where still landing in Hartford but just not Southwest due to some snow(4 inches)). So back to the lay over, I tell my wife who is already in CT and she does some research and finds the Carlton. It offered a free shuttle ride from and to the airport. I was amazed at the service, the front desk manager Steve knew his stuff when I called for the shuttle. When I called for the shuttle Steve asked me where I was in the airport, I told him the baggage claim, he then directed me perfectly through the airport to where the shuttle was waiting. I get on the shuttle get to the hotel. Steve was waiting checked me in, offered me a toothbrush and tooth paste, recommended some good food location around the area and was very pleasant. The rooms where decent for what you pay. The shuttle guys where great and helpful with luggage. Over all I was very pleased with the customer service.",16-Nov-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

1320,"10/19/2018The hotel was very dirty and outdated. The only thing that looked remodeled was the floor. It was 2 small dogs in the lobby which the front desk person told me they they were the hotel dogs. The front desk was dirty. The bathroom in the bedroom had existing dirt on the floor, wall, and stool area. The bathroom door hits the toilet everytime I open and close the door. Our sheets were very dirty (both beds). I reported all these issues and we received clean sheets and was offered our money back and to stay somewhere else, but we were with park, sleep, fly and it was too late to look else where. I asked for the owner and was told that he stays in Colorado and I would have to leave a voicemail. He didn't get back with me, however a note and cookies were left in our vehicle upon our return apologizing for the inconvenience and that my message was received but he didn't want to bother me while I was on vacation. When I reported my issues to the front desk lady, she really wasn't even concerned about my photos she just kept talking. She was a friendly person though. The drivers to and from the airport was prompt and very nice. If you are like me and try to find at least 4 star hotels, you may not want to choose this one because most people are giving them good ratings because the staff are friendly. The hotel is very very dirty and outdated with the small remodeling of the floor.",24-Oct-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

1322,"My husband & I arrived approximately 11 pm & had our alarm set for 4 am. We chose this hotel because of the 24 hour shuttle transportation services to midway for the sleep/park/fly accommodations that they have. While we were only at the hotel for 6 hours, we had a great experience. They're only a 10 minute drive from midway. When we unboarded our return flight, a quick phone call had them out front to pick us up within 10 minutes. Our car was warming up back at the motel & we had chocolate chip cookies & 2 bottles of water waiting for us which made the 2 hour drive home a bit easier since most businesses were closed. All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly. The room was surprisingly put together very well. We were very happy customers & we'll be definitely be returning in February to do it again for sure!",22-Oct-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1323,"We could not have had a better experience. We booked a night for park and fly. When we arrived the night before our flight, we were greeted promptly in a beautiful reception area. When we got to our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find it newly remodeled and cozy. I am confused about the people who were dissatisfied with their rooms; it suited us perfectly. Yes, you can hear planes flying overhead, but that is to be expected when you are 10 minutes from an airport :) This did not bother us at all, and we both slept well. Our shuttle driver to the airport the following morning was prompt and friendly. In addition, when we returned back to Midway, our friendly driver arrived within 10 minutes of our call to pick us up. Our car was waiting for us at the front of the hotel (no walking to find it while lugging our suitcases!) and we were thrilled to find two packages of cookies and two bottles of water waiting for us in the car. We have no complaints whatsoever about the hotel, staff, shuttle service or location.

1324,"This no-nonsense motel in a working-class Hispanic neighborhood is not much to look at but friendly staff and unbeatable prices make it a solid bet for value-conscious travelers, especially if you have a car (there’s free parking) or a pet (it’s dog-friendly, and we were greeted by three dogs belonging to staff). A courtesy van will take you to the nearby subway station or any of the local Hispanic restaurants, although we chose to walk. Oh, and there’s free transportation to and from the airport. The Loop is about half an hour away by subway. Don’t leave the area without a rib-sticking meal at the exceptional Birrieria Zaragoza, which is just around the corner and deservedly famous for its take on an earthy goat dish from Jalisco. One final tip:skip the Carlton Inn’s coffee.",16-Oct-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

1327,We drive and do the Park & Fly package before many vacations. We've been traveling to this hotel for years and it never disappoints; in fact it keeps getting better.

1328,Ran away from a different hotel (from Hell) to a safe Haven at Carlton Inn! I could heat my room as I wished.

1329,"the room was clean and pleasant, but there should be no hiding that this is a motel, not a hotel. you enter from the parking lot and your door entry goes outdoors to that lot. it is in an industrial area, but I suppose many people like the fact that it is close to midway airport. you are in the inner city, which is not great, but it should be noted.",9-Sep-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html

We have about a 2 hour drive to Midway Airport, so for early flights we'll drive up the night before and stay here. They put out a free simple breakfast in the morning which is super convenient and when they know we have to leave before breakfast hours they make sure to set some out before we go. You can leave your car their and they shuttle you right to your terminal which takes so much of the headache out of traveling! When we got back they picked us up at the airport and returned us to our warmed up car with bottled waters and cookies already in it! The shuttle drivers have always been super friendly too!

1331,"My husband and I stayed here one night prior to our flight at Midway. The hotel is in a very busy area near Midway so lots of traffic. Pulling into the parking area we were concerned as parking is very very tight but that was my only concern. From the moment we entered the lobby we were greeted warmly and treated very well. Everyone seemed happy and wanting to help. We made our way to our room quickly and were very pleased with the accommodations. The room was good sized and very clean. We had a fridge in the room which was nice. The bed and pillows were comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. The configuration of the hotel helped decrease any road noise and airplane noise was very minimal. We were on the first shuttle to the airport about 5am and even though breakfast was not to start until 6 I believe, they had put out some breakfast food and coffee for us early risers. The shuttle drivers to and from the airport were professional and friendly. Last but not least, on our return from the airport we were greeted with cookies and cold water waiting for us in our car. Our car also had the air conditioner on so it was nice and cool waiting for our arrival on a hot day. Some people may not like the fact that the car was parked outside and may have been a little dirty but we didn’t mind at all as the excellent service we received more than made up for that tiny matter.We loved the Carlton ❤️ I’m not one for the typical cookie cutter holiday inn hotel. I like personality and cleanliness and hospitality and we got all that with Carlton Inn Midway.",17-Aug-18,Carlton Inn Midway,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d304277-Reviews-Carlton_Inn_Midway-Chicago_Illinois.html
1332,"close to midway airport is the best you can say for the location and facility. the people were helpful and friendly. the facility is an updated 50s motel with parking in front of the room. it is a very compact facility with hardly room to motor between parked cars when the place is at high occupancy. the room was small. my description of it was that the best thing about it was that it didn't take long to get to the bathroom. However, the room was relatively clean but there was that smell of misinfectant. the price is the lowest in the airport area but I am not sure it is worth the saving. I got the impression that people who needed a short overnight for car travel or to go to the airport stay here. We did not use the exercise facility or have the breakfast so I cannot comment on them. there is no food service and if you don't know the area none in reasonable walking distance. this is a place for a short relatively inexpensive overnight were the accommodations and facility are not of great importance.
